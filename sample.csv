0,0,5,A1C6M8LCIX4M6M,0001713353,June Bug,This book is a winner with both of my boys.  They really enjoy the pictures and the story.  It's a classic.
1,1,5,A1REUF3A1YCPHM,0001713353,TW Ervin II,"The King, the Mice and the Cheese by Nancy Gurney is an excellent children's book.  It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it.

It is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. The cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away.  The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs.

The story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king.  The story also teaches cause and effect relationships.

The pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.  I was thrilled to discover that it is back in print.  I *highly* recommend it for children ages 2 to 7."
2,2,5,A1YRBRK2XM5D5,0001713353,Rebecca L. Menner,"My daughter got her first copy from her great-grandmother (it had been my father's when he was a child). She loves it so much that she has worn out two copies now. Colorful pictures, easy to follow words, and wonderful morals (sharing, thinking problems through, and that the easy way isn't always the best way)."
3,3,5,A1V8ZR5P78P4ZU,0001713353,Mindy Stone,I remember this book from when I was a child about 30 years ago and what I most remember was how wonderful the expressions of the various animals had on their little faces.  Absolutely wonderful art work that will make you feel part of the characters in the book.  The moral of this story is great as well.....learn how to share!!!  We need more sharing and caring and this book points it out very delicately and creatively!
4,4,5,A2ZB06582NXCIV,0001713353,B. Deniger,"Just as I remembered it, one of my favorites from childhood! Great condition, very happy to have this to share with my daughter. Packaging was so nice and was received quickly."
5,5,5,ACPQVNRD3Z09X,0001713353,Terri Dickson,"It is a very cute book with great illustrations,with an enjoyable story for children."
6,6,5,AVP0HXC9FG790,0001713353,Amazon Customer,The kids loved it!
7,7,5,A32MQTLQQN44WW,0001713353,jackie hogan,"I was just so hapoy to have found it, thank you for offering !"
8,8,5,A13CHIJPFCEP2M,0001713353,Janice Cunningham,good comdition
9,9,5,A324TTUBKTN73A,0001713353,Tekla Borner,My students (3 & 4 year olds) loved this book!  Definitely recommend it to other teachers.
10,10,5,ADLBKEDYXKXCH,0001713353,LouS,"A thought-provoking fable about unintended consequences.  To get rid of mice, you bring in cats.  But then how do you get rid of the cats?  A favorite of my grandkids (around 5 years old) and my wife (I had better not give her age :-)."
11,11,5,A3MVI1KIZQA9XB,0001713353,Charlie C,My favorite book as a child. My daughter's favorite book also. She was 8. Great moral and awesome illustration. I read it to my daughters class in 2nd grade and it was very well received by all.
12,12,5,A2RE7WG349NV5D,0001713353,Deborah K Woroniecki,LOVE IT
13,13,4,A2GSWEYW6Y4OIY,0001713353,Gary Phillips,Great story. I loved it as a kid and now can read it to my grandkids. A little overpriced but I could not find it anywhere else.
14,14,5,AX8YZYILXC7LT,0001713353,KM,This is a cute story my children used to love. Now my grandson will get a chance to read it as well.  The book has been out of print so I was happy to find a copy.  It arrived promptly in near new condition as described in the sellers comments..
15,15,5,ABZ2UEQ2JRYJ9,0001713353,Doug Ruhman,Perfect!
16,16,5,A32B7QIUDQCD0E,0001713353,E,Great!
17,17,5,A25PQPZXU63223,0001713353,pat brooks,"This was my 51 year old daughters book, got this one as part of her birthday. She will be thrilled"
18,18,5,AUZXLPH8BN28C,0001713353,sharon,Great vintage book
19,19,5,A2VXMOSOTK0W70,0001713353,Kevin Northup,One of my favorite books ever! So glad I found it for my grandson. But I was surprised and didn't understand why it was so rare & expensive. Still worth it for the one I found!
20,20,5,A232U4KSNYAO2R,0001713353,Wendz,"This was a favourite of my children, and we now have a copy for our grandchildren! We can just about remember it word for word."
21,21,5,A1RDVO9NPKWISU,0001713353,Erich Everbach,I'm using this book in a course on sustainability at the college level. In many ways it is better than the Lorax:  more fund and less didactic.
22,22,5,AHHHGMN33KF95,0001713353,tj,It was hard to find this original book in such good shape for the price I paid. I was very happy with it.
23,23,5,A3H9YD6K9TVKDP,0001713353,James Charnock,"Over and over the king has problems.  Fortunately, he has wise men to help him solve his problems.  Unfortunately, his wise men turn one problem into another problem.  So, on top of all his other problems his wise men are a problem too.

Who wants mice all over the place; naughty mice at that?  And so many that they are in your food, even in your beard--you do have a beard?

Well, the wise men have the answer to the problem.  And the king is delighted, but not for long because the problem comes back again and again.  In the end, the king wins ...and the king loses.  How can he both win AND lose?

24,24,5,A3M314LI9OYME,0001713353,Jaleta Clegg,"I remember reading my parents' copy of this book until it fell apart. The story still makes me giggle. I just wanted to share it with my kids, who appreciated it even though most of them are teenagers now. The story is light-hearted and silly, but with a very powerful message about learning to live with the problems you have instead of trading them for larger problems.

The artwork is hysterical, too."
25,25,5,A1YDQQJDRHM0FJ,0001713353,Leila,I am very happy with the book!!!  It is one of my children's favorite books and I was so pleased I could order it here!!!
26,26,5,A1IL1A91CHGU53,0001713353,Belle,I remember reading this when I was a kid.  Favorite book then and so fun to find again.  Read it to my grown kids when it came.
27,27,5,AHXMDCU0N15TN,0001713353,sonybalony,"My copy is so tattered, worn and so loved.  A well done plot on how it's sometimes better to get along, than to try to work the problem."
28,28,5,A2M46WTE5TR5WN,0001713353,SLL,"This was one of my favorites when I was a small child, so I bought a copy for my nephew when he was just starting to read."
29,29,5,ATHTCOG6BB6WK,0001713353,L. Williams,"So, you think you have problems? Things could be worse and this clever book can prove it. The king starts out with a problem. The mice are eating his cheese. The more he tries to fix the problem, the worse it gets. The king finally arranges to bring back the mice when he comes to the realization that his original dilemma  wasn't so intolerable after all. The solution requires cooperation from the king and the mice. It involves the cheese."
30,30,5,A3N7UC72L8TP0Z,0001713353,Nancy Thomas,We had this when I was growing up.  Great book about sharing.  I loved it then and I love it now.
31,31,5,A255PQDLPOCUXP,0001713353,Altbuttercup,"Thanks to Amazon's used seller network, I was able to get a copy of this, a childhood favourite. It's a hit with my 3 and 5 year old boys and in regluar rotation at bedtime. Lots to discuss, from ""it was a good idea at the time"" to table manners. :)"
32,32,5,A3NHMUQN8HAVAW,0001713353,Mumof4,My husband wanted this book to read to our 4 year old daughter ( who loves it).  He would read this to his oldest daughter who is 21 and she use to love it too.  Timeless book!!
33,33,5,A30FZZMVK0N6CA,0001713353,HarrisPap,"All 4 of my grandsons, ages 4,6,11,and 13,love to have me read this book to them."
34,34,5,A16KKR9J6JZELK,0001713353,Mina Gobler,"The King the Mice and the Cheese was one of my children's favorite books over 40 years ago. Now that my friends and I have grandchildren, I've been hunting down copies and sending this book as a gift. The book teaches a marvelous lesson in terms that young children can understand. A king's wonderful cheese attracts local mice who overrun the palace. Wise men bring in ever larger animals to chase away the animals who have only made matters worse. Finally, mice are brought in to chase out the elephants and king is back to where he started. The solution? Bring back the mice and make a pact with them to share the cheese. Last scene is one of the mice at little tables eating their cheese as the king is enjoying his cheese. I still love reading this book to children and highly recommend it!"
35,35,4,AJZL08SGSYBDD,0001713353,Lisa L. Doran,"THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD BOOKS, I HAD TO HAVE IT TO OWN!
RECOMMENDED READING FOR ALL AGES FOR A CHUCKLE!"
36,36,5,A3MA68F62DFNVU,0001713353,Cynthia R. Harp,"My mom bought this for my oldest son.  He and his younger brother loved it.  When the baby rolled around, so to speak, 9 years later, it became his favorite too.  No one, child or , well, old child, fails to be delighted by this story.  Oddly, they all seem to have the same favorite page, too (when the elephants are run out of town by the returning mice). This is a never-fail hit, and cheers everyone up as they face the prospect of the nap."
37,37,5,A1VU0P0OF9DRMT,0001713353,M. Lynch,"My mother first read this book to me when I was a child and I read it to my little brother later.  I bought a copy for myself as an adult and have had great fun sharing with all of the children in my life.  The story is a cautionary tale about the law of unintended consequences and the need to work out your differences. The best thing about the book is the hilarious illustrations.  My children, my husband and I would sit together, making the animal noises and enjoying every part of each picture. (My personal fav is the elephant grabbing the startled king while he talks to his wise men.)  A great book for your family!"
38,38,3,A294QSAEH1Z7YI,0001713353,BHGobuchul,"41 years later:

The cheese is government cheese.

The mice objected to the king's idea of good manners as species-centric, and rebelled.

The king blamed the peasants, and forbade them to keep cats or chase mice from their homes.

This made things worse. Peasants that could afford to do so moved as far away from mice as possible.

I can't wait for the next chapter."
39,39,5,AC4I57VYBGO8P,0001713353,TGM,"One of the best books I have ever read.  The message is deep wisdom that our government leaders and makers of US foreign policy would do well to internalize.

Your kids will like it too."
40,40,4,AKHVEPR68DGPN,0001713353,Tj Bacon,This was one of my favorite books since I was a kid. The pictures were funny and the story has two good lessons in it. People should try to figure out your own problems and don't judge a book by its cover. In this case the mice. The king learned to share his home and his cheese and that's the moral of this story. I would recommended this book to my friends if they where doing this project. It is a great learning experience for kids.
41,41,5,A189H5MS7ECVRX,0001713353,Gwen Coleman,This is a wonderful story and both my 5yo and my 3yo love it (and I like reading it too).  The King wants to get rid of the mice and his wise men keep coming up with progressivly worse solutions until the King is right back where he started -- and creative thinking saves the day!  Great illustrations.
42,42,5,A1RR8Q97PANN98,0001713353,SDSonn,Finally back in print.  What an awesome book.  Loved it as a kid and now one of my kids' favorites.  So happy I can now purchase for my niece.
43,43,5,A1SDAYRVRR62ZH,0001713353,M3 Pete,"To summarize the story, it's all about trying to deal with the problem you have in the first place (mice), rather than bringing in solutions that create even worse problems (cats, dogs, lions and elephants).

But since you will likely be reading it to your kids, the story is not all that important at first.  I had this as a boy and enjoyed the drawings, which gets a kid hooked on a book before anything else.  My two-year-old LOVES this book, and fills in the words every time we get to words like ""king"" ""mice"" ""cheese"" ""lion"", etc.  He really has no idea what the story teaches, but he loves to read it with me, and that's the key to a great kid's book."
44,44,5,A1IG9N5URR82EB,0001061240,avid reader,"I was given this book for my 8th birthday, in the year of its first publication. The Golden Treasury of Poetry was a constant companion; lost, alas, after ""growing up"" and making many life-moves. This year, 2009, 50 years after I first received this book, I recaptured it from a used book dealer in upstate NY, as a birthday present to myself for my 58th birthday. The book is my bridge back in time. A beloved collection of classics for children; don't let yours slip away!"
45,45,4,A3M1GRH7DAKG9H,0001061240,Louise Brokaw,"Before his baby daughter was born, my son paged wistfully through my copy of The Golden Treasury of Poetry.  I had received it from my parents for Christmas in 1961, the year I was 11 and had a weekly assignment to memorize a poem for class.  I had read and recited these wonderful poems to my children when they were little and I knew my son wanted to do the same with his daughter.  But there was no way I was giving up my book!  Amazon came to the rescue with numerous used copies for sale. Obviously a book that was printed over 40 years ago was not in perfect shape, but the description of an intact binding, some corner marks, and a few pen marks was accurate.  I gave it to my granddaughter the night she was born and my son was in tears.  Thank you for being a source of wonderful out-of-print books!"
46,46,5,A1H3A4VJG11WCT,0001061240,book worm,"...I loved the pictures and the poems, and began looking for it 14 years ago for my home.  Wish I'd looked at Amazon a while ago.  The illustrations stay in your mind forever - whimsical and beautiful.  The poems are second to none, and some, I have never found elsewhere.  I just about cried for joy today when I got my hands on MY VERY OWN copy.  Every house should have one!  This book is a true treasure!"
47,47,5,A2PXHROL8DBVGR,0001061240,Ruthann Rawlings,I fell in love with this book in my elementary library. I've paid enough late fines on it in the last 15 years to have bought the book several times over. It's here that I fell in love with Lady Clair and a million other  classics that have resurfaced over and over in my classes in grade school  and college. I want my own copy!
48,48,5,A3UOJT5NCIOS1U,0001061240,dtstroup@grove.net,I am 45; I grew up with this book as our family poetry book-I am no poet but gained magic from having this book on the upstairs shelves to read when I wanted to--my folks didn't push it. I know there are many others but this one let poetry into the life of a hard core boy. I would like to get it for my son.
49,49,5,A2CVLIZ9ELU88,0001061240,A.M.H.,I had this book as a child and loved it. The collection of poems is a broad and deep as I remembered
50,50,5,A2HI7JIZ1EKWRQ,0001061240,Amazon Customer,"One of my favorite books as a child, but got lost in the shuffle of growing up.  Was so happy to have been able to replace it with this excellent condition book."
51,51,5,A2LGACKSC0MALY,0001061240,Sharon Katz,"My aunt bought me this book in 1962 - I was ten years old. My younger sister and I read the poems and loved them all. We marked the book up by writing in it by trying to copy all the great illustrations in it. My dad, sister, and myself would read about Paul Revere's ride and The Common Cormorant and then talk about what we read. My father's favorite poem in it was The Children's Hour. When I was in my 30's I bought myself another copy of it. Both my sister and my dad have passed and this poetry book brings back all the memories that I shared with them. I'm 64 now and still remember the words to my favorite poems in this anthology. It will definitely make memories for any child who is lucky enough to get a copy."
52,52,5,A6EQG0P75KHJ,0001061240,Bookworm 93103,"I agree with another reviewer, that every home should have this book - partly for the poetry, and partly for the amazingly beautiful illustrations by Joan Walsh Anglund that accompany the poems.

This is a book that can be enjoyed by people of any age. It is a wonderful introduction to poetry for children, yet it is not a silly children's book. It is a book full of some of the most beautiful and captivating poetry in the English language.

I grew up with this book, and learned to love literature and poetry, and the magical world between the covers of a book. Oh! What flights of imagination I went on, reading this lovely book.

When I got married, my husband quoted ""Lochinvar"" from memory, substituting his own name for the last word in the Lochinvar poem! I was so surprised, and everyone cracked up laughing. The reason I knew this poem by Sir Walter Scott was because of this book.

""Tiger, Tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the night ..."" - ""The Highwayman came riding, riding, riding ..."" The Fish - ""... And I let the fish go."" Kentucky Belle. The Battle of Bunker Hill. Wynken, Blynken and Nod. Short, funny poems by Ogden Nash. The Blind Men and the Elephant. Abou Ben Adhem - may his tribe increase! So many wonderful poems are in this book.

My old book had fallen apart. I work at a school where bookbinding classes were taught. I brought my book in, and got it fixed.

Now, just last week, although I never got to have children myself, life has given me the amazing gift of two little great granddaughters, ages five and eight. What better gift for them than this book, where they will be able to be enchanted by poetry as I was, to grow with it, and they can read the poem that great-grandpa recited by heart after he got married for the second time, way back before they were born.

I am so grateful to see this book on Amazon. Thank you!"
53,53,5,A2RL015TSMQLRV,0001061240,Judith L.,Louis Untermeyer was a family friend. I grew up with this book and raised my children on the treasures within it. Now it is my grandchildren' turn!
54,54,5,A3LQW5GZSXDXAG,0001061240,Amazon Customer,"I have always liked this book. When my children were young, I read to them and wanted another copy to share with students."
55,55,5,A3O9Q65T1EJYO8,0001061240,Sandy Burner,Book from my childhood I had lost.  Love it and will enjoy having it for my grandchildren.
56,56,5,A1TJ6TAESKL56O,0001061240,E. Guerin,"I've been trying to find this book for a long time. It was a childhood favorite. Although reading it again as an adult does not hold quite the same ""magic,"" it is still quite a good collection. The illustrations are gorgeous. So, so very glad to have found this book again. One of the biggest reasons I love poetry so much now is because I read this book. You can probably enjoy reading it on your own, but if you have a child (or children) to read it to, they will probably love it as well."
57,57,5,A364VBQMMXKX1Q,0001061240,Philip and Melissa Knight-Fitzgerald,This was a wonderful book so I got it as a gift for my niece. It's a very thick book full of different poems on many topics. You will be able to find many that you love.
58,58,2,A3ZG0U3FOF3T1,0001061240,P. Howell,"Looking for a Louis Untermeyer book  from the 1980s and this was not the one,"
59,59,5,A3BE4WPPAOK191,0001061240,Jeanette K. Sleight,I love this book!  Giving this copy to my grand daughter!
60,60,5,A199XJR9ZO0EQ8,0001061240,csmith,"Love, love this book! I am so grateful for it, we've spent many moments bonding while reading these poems, I think this version might be better than the newer one."
61,61,5,AZT95BSNACPRR,0001061240,Cynthia Westervelt,Lifetime FAVORITE!
62,62,4,A3PF93B41F9IDL,0001061240,Bev Weber,Its lovely just what my husband was looking for and how he had remembered it
63,63,5,AOSS6RJIPV8WS,0001061240,J. Voorheis,"I don't know that I can truly explain why I like this book so much. Started reading it to my son and daughter in approx 1960. They loved it and so did I like reading it to them. The Book contains a wonderful collection of poetry of many topics and styles, appealing to from toddlers to adults! I think it is a great family book. Had two more children when the first two were in Middle School. They liked it just as much and now I have given it to their children! Our youngest grandchild wouldn't let her father stop reading it to her in the evening and then demanded permission to take the book to bed. She is only 22 months old.
Somewhere along the line in moving around the book was lost. I just bought it for my husband and me. Love it. Thank you Louis Untermeyer for this collection!"
64,64,5,A2QL1VNS6O65IK,0001061240,S. Williams,This book is one that I received as a gift when I was in my teens and loved it.  I read it to my children growing up and wanted to have the opportunity to share it with my grandchildren but found it was out of print for many years.  Fortunately it is such a classic that the original owners have retained it in good condition realizing that this is a book to be shared.  I have been able to locate a total of two books to give to each of the families of my children. It is a cherished part of a family tradition.
65,65,5,A1PZIHJAT8TG3W,0001061240,seagypsy,"The poetry and illustrations are splendid.  Although the book seems directed at children, adults will be inspired as well. It is one of those books that would stay in the family for generations.  ""Golden Treasury"" is the right name for it!  My dad gave me this book when I was about eight.-- this was in the seventies.  It inspired me to write poetry and I won a poetry contest in school because of it.  Somehow the collection reminds me of a better time, when people valued good things and were more sweet and innocent."
66,66,5,AYIPHN7Q2TBM3,0001061240,C. Reynolds,"I grew up with this poetry book.  I loved it then, I love it now.  Too bad it is out of print."
67,67,5,A31QP3G4FS2A90,0001061240,Jo Barnes,"I rated this a five because it's the first book I used to introduce my-now 45 year old-son to poetry.  Custard the Magic Dragon was read over and over and he still remembers it to this day.  It's a charming mix of poetry, rhymes and stories in verse.  You'll treasure it for your children-and for yourself. If you can find a copy, get one and enjoy all it has to offer with your kids or by yourself."
68,68,5,A3MMEIRXMH6QU3,0001061240,Nancy Freedman,"A must for every home, with or without children. Delightful! Each and every poem is a classic treasure. Wonderful to read out loud."
69,69,5,A2C81B811FA56V,0001061240,Helen D. Setterfield,"One of my daughters, growing up, also loved this book, which I had had when I was a teenager.  Because she was a bit careless, the cover was destroyed.  It is so great to have a good copy again of this lovely collection which I can now read to my grandchildren.  The Anglund illustrations are, of course, delightful, and many of the selections simply cannot be found anymore, of either the poems or the illustrations.  A priceless book."
70,70,5,A3QYDL5CDNYN66,0001061240,Verita,"This was a favorite. I think it changed my life when I was just a child. I became a poetry lover and am one still. Simple, beautiful poems appropriate for children but not childish at all. Whitman, Hopkins, many famous poets included here. All these years later I can still remember lines from it. Genevieve Taggard's Millions of Strawberries came to me while I was eating strawberries a friend gave me. Although I could not remember the title, thanks to the wonders of the internet, I searched for the lines I remember and found the text. Then, I went to the bookshelf (I still have the book) and read it and many others. Fond, fond memories."
71,71,5,A2A4SCGVEDWOX9,0001061240,M. Fieleke,"This is a favorite childhood book of mine.  I hunted it down after getting married in hopes of reading it to my children someday.  It's filled with wonderful classic poems.

It has some funny, witty poems but it doesn't have many of the ""silly"" slapstick style poems that are so common in kids poetry to day.  While some may see that as a liability, I think it's a great thing to expose kiddos to good literature from a young age.  If all kids digest is junk food, they will get fat.  If all they read is silly, slapstick poetry they will have a harder time appreciating classic stuff later on."
72,72,5,AHJZLIXZUDSTD,0001061240,Cynthia Cross,This was a favorite childhood book and I purchased it for my grandchildren.  It arrived in a timely manner and is in excellent condition.  Thank you!
73,73,5,A35NBIN3NJK75S,0001061240,Winter,"I fondly recall this collection of some of the world's best loved poetry. I've not read it in forty years, yet I can still recite passages word for word.

I remember pouring over the poems, asking my mother what certain things meant, they disappearing to read some more. Lady Clair haunted my imagination, as did bold Lochenvar. And who wouldn't laugh at the little girl with the curl, right in the middle of her forehead? To this day I have a copy of Lone Dog by Irene Rutherford Mcleod hanging in my work cube, lovingly handwritten by my grandaughter, who now has the book and loves it like I did.

My all time favorite poem, I must admit, is the The Hiwayman, by Alfred Noyes. I'm about to publish my eighth romance novel, and if I retrace my literary steps, I'll find an eleven-year-old girl sighing over the tragically doomed lovers.

Though years have passed, this volume stands the test of time."
74,74,5,A2RJ8F39GFP9G9,0001061240,Ann L. Sims,"This volume is a memory from my childhood, filled with lovely poems that my father read to me before bed.  I've been looking for it for 10 years.  Now I will read it to my grand-daughters."
75,75,5,A2I3SX01TVDJJB,0001061240,Aaron White,"This book was given to my mom when she was 13 from her sister. She used to draw from the illustrations inside. When I was about 10, she let me start drawing from it. I absolutely love it! I have used it over the years to draw from, and now I teach art, and my students draw from these beautiful pen and ink illustrations. The book is lovely and full of wonderful poems and collections. And although the poetry is wonderful, I have to say the illustrations are my favorite ever. This is a classic you don't want to pass up!"
76,76,5,A1VT3VPFRB050F,0001061240,Debra Brodersen,It's a flash back to the past.  I loved this book of poetry when I was in high school.  This book was in pristine condition.

The illustrations are wonderful, linear drawings that any child or adult will love.  I remember putting tracing paper over them to reproduce them when I was a child.  This is a book to be shared with children and grandchildren.  I am buying a copy for my new grandson to enjoy.  I hope he will enjoy ""The Raggedy Man"" and ""Poor Old Lady"" as much as I did and my own children did.  My old copy is in bad shape and the binding is coming unglued,it has been loved alot."
78,78,5,A20J9UEYG47LZL,0001061240,W. Richter,My mother used to read me several of the poems from this book in the early 1970's. Now I have a chance to do the same for my daughter. I was glad to find an older copy on Amazon that was in fairly good shape.

She writes poetry and short stories, and draws pictures to go along with her stories.  She always looks at it when she comes to visit, and it has inspired her to write some very sweet stories.

I was very, very pleased to find a copy on amazon.

87,87,4,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0001712799,Lawrance Bernabo,"""Great Day for Up"" is a unique Dr. Seuss book and you can tell this just by looking at the cover.  That is because while the book is written by Dr. Seuss it features the jolly drawings of the English artist Quentin Blake.  Until this point every time I have read a book written by Dr. Seuss it was also illustrated by Dr. Seuss and when somebody else did the drawings Dr. Seuss used the name Theo. LeSieg (which is ""Geisel"" backwards).  So the fact that this is a real ""Dr. Seuss"" book drawn by somebody else is pretty special.
This Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word ""up"" as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a ""Great day for up!""  You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves.  Besides, by the end of ""Great Day for Up"" we get to the point where ""EVERYONE on Earth is up!"" (with one very important and rather ironic exception).
As with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed ""The Cat in the Hat,"" which was the ""Harry Potter"" of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.  This is not one of the most interesting volumes in the series, but overall these books were a delight."
88,88,4,A1U1EY5QFJULO5,0001712799,Rachel,"Ya, ya, ya so this book teaches about the meanings of the word ""up"".  But, to me that takes a backseat to the fun rhythm and rhymes that make a child WANT to be able to read the book by themselves.  The small vocabulary, phonetically spelled words and visual clues are wonderful for early readers.  My step-son enjoys reading this book together at bedtime and can actually read it to US now.  I love the ""bright and early"" books from Dr. Seuss for building early reading skills."
89,89,3,AJ8AQG2X9JJ2Y,0001712799,Donald Gillies,"Dr. Seuss has some really brilliant books.  This book is just a so-so Dr. Seuss.  As a parent who is familiar with about 15 Dr. Seuss books, this is one of my least favorite books.
The book attempts to teach the child what ""Up"" means.  There is a terrific amount of repetition, and the cleverness in the rhyming and pictures is not ""Up!"" to par with other Dr. Seuss books.
My 6-month old children are too young to understand this book, but I think that Mommy and Daddy will tire of the book long before they have gotten the very simple and trivial message in this book : what is the difference between Up and Down ..."
90,90,5,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,0001712799,Donald Mitchell,"Children are normally confused by the multiplicity of meanings that a simple word can have when they start reading.  Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what ""up"" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings.
""Up! Up!  The sun is getting up.
The sun gets up
so UP with you!""
Thus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes.
Once he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects).
Then, Dr. Seuss returns to ""up"" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel).
Then, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed:
""Wake ever person,
pig and pup,
till EVERYONE
on Earth is up!""
Then comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years.
At first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying ""up"" means in terms of cause and effect.
The book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings.
After your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for ""up"" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use ""arise"" or ""rise"" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use.
May all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!"

The illustrations are done by Quentin Blake so are not typical of Dr. Seuss.  They are interesting, colorful and fun.  The story is simple and repetitious making it easy for young readers to learn how to read new words.  Alongside the every day words, there are a few new things children might not know such as stilts and buttercups.  This is a fun early reader that makes learning to read easy due to repetition and rhyming.  It is written on the end of first grade reading level.  Recommended for grades k-2."

130,130,4,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,0001712799,Bachelier,"Dr. Suess's scansion and made-up words annoy me. My tri-lingual children have a hard enough time differentiating and isolating Standard English words, so I generally avoid Suess.
The volume is a rare welcome exception (there are a few Suessisms) and is an excellent book for first readers.

The story is plain, with the major intention of teaching your child to *read* his or her first words in English (in this case the word is ""up"").

But Quentin Blake's illustrations are superb and worth the price of the volume alone.

The conclusion is a bit silly, and has a rather lazy aspect to it that parents need to guide their children on (no, it isn't okay to sleep in bed all day like the boy in the story, this is just a silly book""), but mostly this is unobjectionable."
131,131,4,A2B1GZIRD6W646,0002006448,David W. Nicholas,"This is one of those books that purports to be about something, and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated. The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world.

For the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do).

This one proviso aside, there's a lot of intersting material here, and the book is well-written, the characters drawn interestingly, and the settings well-rendered. I would recommend this book."
132,132,4,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,0002006448,Newton Ooi,"Hand-woven carpets are one of the few products that Central Asia has consistently exported to the rest of the world, and by which the rest of the world knows of central Asia.  As such, a traversal of the routes and bazaars that comprise the carpet trade would take one through many of the important places in Central Asia.  Likewise, dealing with those involved in the trade would give insight into the history, economics and culture of those living in this area.  This then is the subject of this book.

The author travels the bazaars and trade routes of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Kashmir looking for carpets.  While doing so, his interactions with the locals open up a whole world of history, culture, religion, food, and habits that are alien to those in the west.  Whether it is how to barter over goods, or the proper way to greet an older woman, the stories told by Mr. Kremmer bring to life places that many of us will never visit, yet that comprises a large part of this world both spatially and historically.

The author intersperses his accounts with character studies of the various individuals he meets, side stories to fill in local histories, and editorials that connect what he seens in these far-off places to what occurs in Washington D.C. and the stockmarkets of the West.  Overall, a great travel book, a great history book, and a great story that is told.  I highly recommend this book."
133,133,3,A1JS302JFHH9DJ,0002006448,Daniel H. Bigelow,"The Carpet Wars is a sampler of informal writing from Australian journalist (and avid carpet collector) Christopher Kremmer over ten years in Central Asia.  Since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9/11, when the area was not established in the West's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations.
Kremmer writes of his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kashmir, and Iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  He enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated Afghan dictator Mohammed Najibullah and legendary guerilla Ahmad Shah Massoud to various carpet dealers Kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  Between these character sketches and Kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the Asian carpet.
The result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  Kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the Central Asian economy and politics.  Besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, The Carpet Wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the Taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine.
(Kremmer's book also taught me that I'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an Asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)"
134,134,5,A26QTCZG2XR3JH,0002006448,David,"I finished this book about six weeks ago, and I can't stop thinking about it.
So often travel literature-type books by westerners in these kinds of far-off places can be either too clever, cynical or condescending at one end of the scale, or, at the other end too reverent, with a reverence that seems to really be an I-hate-where-I-am-from complex. Both extremes can get tiring pretty quickly.
The Carpet Wars was exactly in the middle, and it was fascinating. It was extremely informative about the history, politics, religion and, yes, even the carpets of the region from Pakistan to Iran.  Carpets were merely the thread (so to speak) that held the several first-hand accounts of travels to the region.
Kremmer is a master story teller, and very funny.  Sometimes it was hard to tell what was more enjoyable, the story he was telling or the way he was telling it.
His accounts of places with which he is very familiar are told in the rich tones of a deep affection.  When he is in a new place, like Isfahan, the account is in the vivid colors of someone seeing something for the first time, creating some of the best travel essays I have ever read. Seven weeks ago, Isfahan was just an exotic name to me, now it's at the top of places I hope I can see before I die.
Its hard to say what recommends this book more, the fact that it is throughly enjoyable, or deeply infomrative.
I haven't read Mr. Kremmer's book about Laos, but it is probably pretty good.  Books like The Carpet Wars don't stick with you so long by accident."
135,135,5,A1AV8G3QMHK2ST,0002006448,P. Hoyle,"This is a great book! The author is not just riding the wave of interest surrounding the 9 11 incident. It looks at the Central Asian region form a very different point of view than any book I have read. The writing style is fast paced and easy to read, the author really knows this area of the world first hand. If you are interested in carpets you will find lots to interest you also. ( I don't know the first thing about carpets)
If you read it you will enjoy it!"
136,136,5,A36X9BU9JB8KCE,0002006448,Adriel C. Gray,"Anyone interested in the fine art of rug weaving, the cultures in which Oriental carpets originate, the geography of ancient trade routes including The Silk Road, the history, economics and politics of the Middle East, and present day travel through the strife-torn region will find immense treasure in Christopher Kremmer's The Carpet Wars.  ""The early Muslims inhabited lands where people were born on carpets, prayed on them, and covered their tombs with them.  For centuries, carpets have been a currency and an export, among the first commodities of a globalized trading system"" writes the author, who has spent ten years in Asia reporting for the Australian press.  He uses Oriental rugs as his motif for writing about his travels in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Tajikistan, Kashmir, and the former Soviet satellite countries of Central Asia.  {Here, this reviewer admits his interest enfolds some bias because of my own travels through the region as a Peace Corps worker in less turbulent times.  Also, I have the good fortune of working in a store where a wide variety of the very finest examples of Oriental carpets are sold.}
 In this book we read that second only to oil, hand made carpets are the region's principal export and were so long before Marco Polo made his famous travels along the Silk Road.  Carpets created by various quarreling factions from the Middle and Near East are the focus for retelling how the fighting clans have damaged the carpet trade, effectively wiping out the middle and upper class of society, and left appalling poverty and misery in its wake.  Kremmer describes how that even in the midst of war and turmoil, a bazaar will spring up during breaks in the fighting and the carpet merchants will quickly resume business as if nothing had happened.  A disappointment for me was that the author omits a description of the many varieties and techniques of rug making; he remains focused on his travels through the Islamic world, giving us the benefit of his first hand witness to the misery.
 Believing that only Allah can create anything perfect, the Muslim carpet makers often will deliberately craft a minor flaw in their handiwork that only a practiced eye might discern.  Also, we learn that many rugs woven by people living under the duress of conflict will reflect their anxieties and turmoil through the symbols of war - airplanes, helicopters, tanks, and guns.  But the rugs also will contain symbols of their makers' traumatic lives not altogether discernible or understood.  Like the great paintings of the Renaissance, these works of art may never be fully comprehended.  It is enough that fortunate owners of hand knotted and woven rugs might appreciate not only their beauty but also how they portray the soulful deeper meaning of the lives of their creators, leaving a legacy for generations to come.  This book is an armchair journey of immense interest.  Highly recommended.

Even if you've been to an Arab souk or an Iranian bazaar, you've probably never come close to the real source of these beautiful objects. Kremmer's trek to the rug-making heartlands helps you appreciate that the carpet on your living room floor didn't materialise in a dealer's show room but was rather the product of a completely different society."
138,138,5,A2MOBMVHECYVLE,0002006448,saliero,"Christopher Kremmer's book takes you on a journey through the Central Asian countries most frequently in the news today, and provides an incomparable insight. The largest, and first, section, is an account of events in Afghanistan, which he has witnessed first-hand as a foreign correspondent.
This book is no dry history, nor is it merely a travelogue, nor is it merely an extended piece of journalism.
Kremmer comes to know and befriend people of different backgrounds within the region, and it is their stories, as well as the carpet trade and stories of emblematic carpets, through which the narrative is woven. We care about the future of the peoples of the region, because we care about what becomes of Kremmer's friends.
What Christopher has managed to do is to make the internecine politics, the inhumanities, the brutalities, comprehensible, through his humanisation of peoples who might in lesser hands be reduced to the merely 'exotic' or even worse 'unknowable and inhuman'.
Earlier this year I read 'Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan' by Jason Elliot.
I thoroughly recommend both these books if you desire to reach some understanding of a region of such importance to us all."
139,139,3,A2VDN6OJOIY74W,0002005263,B. Sloane,"I love this series, but this entry is not Hillerman's best stuff.  I'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee don't allow much development at this point.  The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life, so evident in the best Leaphorn/Chee stories, are mostly missing here.  Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee/Bernie Manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way.  If you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of Hillerman's considerable talent; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best."
140,140,4,A1POJBC0L210UT,0002005263,Ellen L. Beno,"I can almost smell the dry red clay and see that beautiful blue sky as I read this book. This book is a quick read but has some interesting twists to it.  I can close my eyes and remember traveling a small state highway along the Great Divide on my way to see the V.L.A. near Datil, NM.  I had read only a couple of the Jim Chee/Leaphorn books when I visited Gallup, New Mexico in 92 and 93 but I almost expected to see one of the books' characters appear at the Giant Truck Stop coffee shop or one of the tiny diners we saw on Hwy 36.  Jim seems to be taking a big step in this book so I will wait patiently for another of these charming suspensful novels and I hope my husband gets me this one on tape too.  Thank you Tony Hillerman."
141,141,4,A2X9XKFB18UQCU,0002005263,bestseller92,"""The Sinister Pig"" (a term which has a couple of meanings in the book) is another fine addition to Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee series.  This one involves a somewhat more complex plot than most of the previous ones, and as for character development, Mr. Hillerman seems to take it for granted that the readers of this book have also read at least some of the others, and that therefore he does not need to go into too much detail as to the personalities of his characters.  Having said that, though, I enjoyed the book very much, and my only real complaint is, as with ""The Wailing Wind"", it is, at about 230 pages, just too short.  But it is always a rare treat to be reunited with our old friends from the Navajo Tribal Police, and as an added bonus this edition features a happy ending romantically for the ever-lovelorn Jim Chee.  Here's hoping Mr. Hillerman keeps the Leaphorn/Chee series coming, and that he adds a hundred or so pages to his next tale."
142,142,4,AEC46NVS07MJ9,0002005263,charles falk,"Legendary lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and his protege, sergeant Jim Chee, have come a long way in the sixteen Hillerman books in which they have figured.  The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman.
A CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, ""Cowboy"" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol.
As in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow.
We know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest.
Hillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.  Should we ask for anything more?"
143,143,4,A9ANMVCEOQ8P7,0002005263,Bruce Trinque,"""The Sinister Pig"" is another in Hillerman's long-running series of mystery novels centering upon the now retired, but hardly inactive, Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police.  This time the plot is in part inspired by the continuing scandal over the mismanagement - embezzlement and outright theft may be closer to the point - of funds due to Southwest Indian tribes for oil, gas, and coal taken from their reservations under Federal auspices.  An investigator sent by a powerful Washington, DC, senator to nose around turns up dead with a bullet in his back.  It is Jim Chee's case - or at least as much of the case as the FBI will let him handle - but it is immediately clear that somebody with high connections back in Washington wants the investigation squelched.
Meanwhile, Jim Chee has something else on his mind.  Bernadette Manuelito, formerly an officer in the Navajo Tribal Police, has taken a new job with the Border Patrol, 200 miles away, just when Chee was working up his resolve to make his personal interest clear to her.  And now Bernie has stumbled on some mysterious goings-on along the Mexican border that might tie in to the unsolved murder back home.
Hillerman departs somewhat from his usual format by writing several chapters from outside the viewpoint of Leaphorn and Chee (and Bernie Manuelito).  Unlike in most Hillerman novels, we very quickly learn who the bad guys are, although a mystery remains until the final chapters as to exactly what they are doing.  In general Hillerman's villains are not especially villainous, their motivations often arising from quite ordinary circumstances that lead them into crimes they never intended.  But in ""The Sinister Pig"" the chief villain is as close to plain evil as Hillerman is ever likely to get.
One disappointment: an element which usually sets Hillerman's mystery novels apart from all others is their exploration of the culture and religion of the Navajos and their Indian neighbors, this being integral to the book plot and often crucial to the solution of the mystery at hand.  In the present novel we see almost nothing of this, except for some peripheral matters that only touch upon Jim Chee himself.  Washington powerbrokers are a less engaging group than the people of the Big Rez.
""The Sinister Pig"" is not the best of Hillerman, to be sure, and it might be argued that it works primarily as simply being part of a continuing series about characters to whom we have come to feel close over the years.  But a Hillerman book that is not amongst his best work is still a good mystery.  And readers who count Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as literary friends will want to find what has now happened in their personal lives.
Hillerman's Navajo novels have continuing background stories that develop from novel to novel over time.  Therefore, readers new to Hillerman would be well advised to begin not with this latest novel but back at the beginning of the series, getting to know the characters as their lives evolve.  There's plenty of good reading to be had along the way."

It seems that I  have been reading these books for a good part of my 71 years. Now that I  have discovered Anne Hillerman novels I will be reading Leaphorn and Chee stories for the foreseeable future."

148,148,5,A33WRKQCQ2R9JJ,0002005263,Mary S,"Another great Hillerman story. Interesting plot, great characters, happy ending for Bernie and Chee, not much more I can say."
149,149,3,ARVOX5K5ZJOJR,0002005263,Daniel,"Not everything I read is an ARC ... I'm a pretty dedicated library user as well.

I've long been a fan of the American Southwest.  It is one of my favorite places to visit and vacation.  I've also been aware that Tony Hillerman - a name that any bibliophile should recognize - writes mysteries set in the American Southwest.  So why haven't I read his works before this? Mostly I think it's because I've only recently developed an affection for the mystery/thriller genre.

Although sixteenth in a series, I don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.  The reader is likely to understand some of the character relationships that have developed over the course of the series, but the story itself seems to be contained within the covers.

Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito once worked for the Tribal Police but now is a Border Patrol/Customs Officer.  She quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around Mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. She becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  Unknown to Bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is Sergeant Jim Chee, who is madly in love with Bernie.  The old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. But knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to Bernie, Chee, and Joe Leaphorn.

I found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery/thriller fare. The bad guys were appropriately bad, but they also seemed sort of 'Bond' bad - stereotyped bad guys.  Wealthy, white, powerful, connected.

I found the set-up really interesting and the regular characters pretty believable and worth following for a couple more books at least, but I was disappointed in the 'resolution' of the story.  I'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control.

As I say, this was pretty average.  It often felt very dated, not just but how characters were acting, but how they were being portrayed.  I'll read a few more and see how I feel about the series.

Looking for a good book?  <em>The Sinister Pig</em> by Tony Hillerman is a pretty average mystery set in the American Southwest."
150,150,5,A353L9MM29O3UV,0002005263,Steve Brannan,This has been one of the MOST captivating and intriguing of Hillerman's books yet!
151,151,3,A3VTEB4N3JVPYF,0002005263,retiredandlovinit,"The plot and action are fine. Tony Hillerman certainly can tell a story, and although this one is only on Navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book, Hillerman does an excellent job of re-setting the scene in southernmost New Mexico as Officer Bernie Manueliti leaves the Tribal Police for a new job with the US Border Patrol. Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito. All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel, and I missed that. I still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak ""romance"" between Chee and Manuelito. It never felt real or genuine, and its lame, sobbing 1950s-style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair. All mystery lovers and Tony Hillerman fans expect better from such a skilled author."

There is a conflict between Bernie and Chee over them getting back together after a separation while an enemy lurks in the shadows to cover up a murder for well, you can guess the motive.  I really like his novels since they provide a glimpse into Native American life which I rarely find in other books.

207,207,3,A3MBENSVWGUFRK,0002005263,Carl Alves,"This novel starts off with Navajo Tribal Police sergeant Jim Chee finding a corpse in tribal lands near a natural gas field.  The FBI is trying to take over the case, saying that it was a hunting accident.  Joining Chee on the case is the familiar characters of Joe Leaphorn and Bernadette Manuelito.  Conspiracies abound, and not surprisingly, the US government aren't necessarily the good guys.

 This is a solid novel, perhaps a little better than some other Hillerman novels I have read.  The plot is logical, the writing professional.  The downfall is that nothing really stands out about this novel.  Its not the sort of novel that youll remember long after you read it.  Its descent enough to pass the time and is a solid read, but not particularly memorable.

I enjoy his two prominent characters, Jim Chee, a young traditional & Joe Leaphorn, the older, but non-traditional Navajo.

This tale starts of rather obliquely with the death of an unidentified man seemingly unconnected to the new border patrol job acquired by Officer Bernie Manuelito. The plot unfolds rather rapidly after Bernie's picture shows up in some bad places in Mexico. Actually, the plot unfolds too rapidly and takes away the mystery usually captured in Hillerman tales.

She suggested Tony Hillerman as a good author to learn more about the Navajo culture.  And she was right, I am.  The Sinister Pig is easy reading and educational in more ways than one even realizes as they are reading.  You don't have to pause to wonder what the author means, it is clear as day.  The one thing I wish I had known before purchasing the Sinister Pig is the fact that the many many Hillerman books go in order.  So, I did not have much background information on the characters.  It is possible to still read it, Hillerman does provide some facts from previous books. But, I believe it would have been better if I went in order.  It would have been a much more rounded book with more sympathy or empathy for these characters, provided by reading the previous books. Which I now plan on."

214,214,5,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,0002005263,Bernie (xyzzy),"Not quite the Hillerman formula but done well just the same. All our old friends are in this story and it looks like everything can be wrapped up if Hillerman decided would be his last. However, it looks like there is at least one more novel and probably two. In this novel, we get to be into the heads of the good guys and bad guys from the start as they banter around.

An ex-CIA spy with knowledge of the oil industry is sent to find out information on how oil companies bypass paying royalty money to the First Nations Trust Fund. He ends up committing suicide with a bullet in the back. Mean while way down south Bernie now with the U.S. Customs Service gets lost, goes off the map, and puts her foot in it.

Bernie's co-worker gets suspicious and tells Joe. Jim gets out some snaps; Joe gets out his maps; Bourbonette gets out the coffee and brains. They hold a committee to figure out what is happening.

Will Bernie smell what she stepped in, or just walk right in to her demise?

Will the cavalry arrive over the hill in time (does not look promising?)

219,219,5,A1NMMEMQXWKEY5,0002005263,Kindle Customer,"I believe this was Tony Hillerman's last work before his death?  If so, it is a fitting last hurrah to a stellar writing career.  Plot,  characterization, dialogue were all imaginative and superbly written.  It is a story of good (Leaphorn and Chee) and innocence (Bernadette Manuelito) vs super-rich and powerful evil, and a man who redeems himself from evil through his love for a good, although flawed, woman.  Good, innocence, and redemption, after much suspense emerge victorious, of course, and my only disappointment is that the author did not give the villain a more fitting end.  I will miss Hillerman and his characters, his respect for American Indian culture, and the thoroughly Catholic world view that underlies his novels.  Requiescat in Pace."

It also shifts the focus from the retired Leaphorn to Jim Chee and especially Bernie Manuelito.  I found some of their decisions puzzling, to say the least.

The plot here is also weaker than others. The story rests on a device that I have seen elsewhere, in both film and novels, including a variant in one of the older James Bond movies. Its not that mysterious, and unfortunately I did not find the denouement at all credible.

Still, Hillerman knows how to move a story along. Its a decent airplane read."

238,238,5,A324NNSMM9EFML,0002005263,Patto,"Officer Bernadette Manuelito is a good investigator  intrepid, clever and resourceful. But it's these very qualities that seem to get her in difficulties. Now she's no longer a cop working for Sergeant Chee at Shiprock. Partly to forget Chee, who's failing to get romantic, she takes a job on the Mexican border. There she encounters some shady characters and dicey situations on a mysterious ranch stocked with exotic game animals.

Chee meanwhile is occupied with a mysteriously well-dressed unidentified dead body. Leaphorn too gets involved in this case.  But neither is too busy to worry about Bernie and get involved in her complications.

Bernie gets a quick education on border patrolling, and so do we. There is a wonderfully despicable villain in the plot, and an unexpected hero.

Chee's best friend Cowboy Dashee also plays a role. He's an Apache and prone to poke fun at Navajos, the heredity enemy of his tribe. His quips are always amusing.

The Leaphorn and Chee mysteries are consistently delightful, with clever plots, tense action, engaging characters, terrific atmosphere, and always a fascinating picture of Native American culture in New Mexico.

But I will add that my husband, a fellow Hillerman fan, found this book a bit weak with the contrivance of too many coincidences. I also read in a book by Anne Hillerman that The Sinister Pig gave Hillerman the most trouble of all his books, because he was less familiar with the location. I love these books so much that I'm not critical of the contrivances. But see what you think."

The book lives up to his usual standard of excellence and was fun to read while at the same time giving me an opportunity to look into the way of the native americans in a very positive and insightful manner. I did not read it expecting anything other than to be entertained so cannot comment on anything but his ability as a storyteller -- great storyteller.

266,266,3,A39QEKNEFSJ34Q,0002005263,hrladyship,"If you're thinking of buying The Sinister Pig to get your Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee fix, you might want to look for another Hillerman novel.  This book centers on Chee's new love, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, once a member of the Navajo police force.  As the book opens, Bernie, as she's called, has transferred to the Border Patrol.  She's miserable because she misses Chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . .  Well, it's an old story.

Meanwhile, Chee is agonizing about her being gone, but doesn't want to pick up the phone and call her or go to see her because she might tell him to get lost or . . .  Yeah, an old story.

With this kind of start, a reader might think it's going to be the old saw about the man rescuing his lovely girlfriend, realizing how much he loves her, and they live happily ever after.  Well, not quite.

Getting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as Hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another.  It would seem that he heard about how the ""pig"" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story.  It certainly is the centerpiece of this story.  Oh, that and a hit man who . . .  Mustn't give that away either.

For all its seeming shortcomings, The Sinister Pig provides bits of Leaphorn and Chee for diehard Hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of New Mexico to ponder.  It's short and a quick read, more a novella really, while not fully satisfying, not terribly disappointing either."
267,267,4,A1XTWXIMUCDGQE,0002005263,Oddsfish,"The consensus on Amazon clearly seems to be that The Sinister Pig is one of Hillerman's lesser works. In some ways, I'd agree. It's certainly different, in important respects, from his other mysteries set in the Four Corners region. Primarily, it lacks the anthropological focus that's helped to make Hillerman's mysteries so unique and enjoyable over the years. The Native American cultures, which provide surprising depth to the characters as they negotiate their identities up against their traditions, and which also establish the cosmic setting in which the events of the novel are understood, are only hinted at in the novel. Not even the title is drawn from Native American mythology; it's a term borrowed from the oiling industry. So, there's no doubt that a large part of the formula that has produced Hillerman's success is lacking. That's worth knowing going into the book.

But that said, I still enjoyed The Sinister Pig, just for different reasons than normal. The book is pretty well-plotted, as is usual for Hillerman. I've really thought that some of the the complaints against the plot I've read (i.e. having a good idea of the who masterminded the crime early on) were oversold, since those elements tend to appear in other Hillerman novels. The Sinister Pig's plot, though not as complex as always, is perfectly sensible and features a fine red herring. Mainly, though, I enjoyed the book because the rest of the series has taught me to admire and care for Hillerman's characters, especially for Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito here, and The Sinister Pig features important progress for them. That's the main thing that's different about The Sinister Pig. Hillerman has always used anthropology and myth to augment and enrich the mysteries, and that's gotten him his audience. Here, however, he'a a little more traditional, using simple romance, instead, as the special extra ingredient. That switch will leave many Hillerman fans less satisfied with this volume, and The Sinister Pig is also not the place to begin reading Hillerman. But I certainly thought it was fine for a change. I enjoyed it as a solid and light little mystery that also brought about some pleasant developments for two of my favorite characters."
268,268,3,AN8C7BGR98HLN,0002005263,Nash Black,"Tony Hillerman's THE SINISTER PIG reads like a half-hearted effort to fulfill a contract, not to tell a good story.
Some great threads are inherent, but the unravel instead of weave. The reader is bounced from the border where Bernie Manuelito is now working to the Four Corners for a murder. The strongest theme is embezzlement of tribal funds, but here Hillerman waxes lightly.
Okay, but not his best.
Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
269,269,3,AI0BCEWRE04G0,0002005263,Stoney,"THE SETUP
An apparently retired CIA agent (Gordon Stein, aka David Slate) is hired by a U.S. Senator to investigate how a natural gas pipeline system has been used to cheat Native Americans in the Southwest of $4 billion annually in royalties.  He is murdered on Navajo land in the extreme northwestern corner of New Mexico.  Navajo Tribal Policeman (Sargent) Jim Chee is assigned to assist the FBI in the investigation.  In the meantime Bernadette Manualetto has resigned from the tribal police, because she is annoyed with Chee for not pursuing her, and has joined (implausibly) the Border Patrol, and thus is stationed in the extreme southwestern corner of New Mexico, along the Mexican border.  She observes some odd ""goings-on"" on the large private Tuttle Ranch on the border.  That's the setup.

COMMENTS
Earlier novels in the series were very ""economical"", with a few well developed characters, and straightforward filler-free stories.  With the previous novel, ""Wailing Wind"", and even more-so with the ""Sinister Pig"". Hillerman is (unfortunately?) entering the mainstream of police mystery novels, with dozens of named characters, most throw-away (i.e., that appear on one or two pages, never to be heard from or of again, with no particular significance to the novel); and complex plots.  The stories are no longer about Native Americans, but rather are about ""white people"" who coincidentally interact somehow with Jim Chee, et al.  The fascinating expositions on Native religion and philosophy is over, except for thin references.  Fortunately, Hillerman is sufficiently talented to keep up with mainstream mystery writers.  But I, for one, miss the earlier character-centric and Native-centric novels.

CAVEATS
The novel is unnecessarily confused by two premises:  1) The first is that pipelines were being used in the rip-off of Native American royalties.  That simply makes no sense---the routing of petroleum in pipelines is irrelevant, just as irrelevant as the highways a petroleum tanker truck drives on.  It is in the accounting that any rip-offs of Native American royalties could have taken place.  2) The second premise is a cocaine importation scheme.  It looks like these two storylines were intended to converge, but don't.

Other evidence of rushed, poorly-edited writing, are redundancies, such as the multiply repeated explaination of the functioning of pipeline pigs.

Readers are teased with the promise of a delicious expose of political corruption, then perhaps a scheme by Al Queda to smuggle nuclear weapons into the U.S., but are finally left with a few sleazy druggies.  Certainly, when you start turning over rocks, the slimy creatures you find are not necessarily the ones you were looking for, but, in the final analysis there was no adequate reason for the murder of Slate/Stein.

Moreover, unless I misread the book, the illegal-alien family which Bernie rescued had immigrated on rumors that a copper smelter on the U.S. side of the border would be reopened.  (The fictional smelter closely corresponds to the Hildalgo Smelter, which was closed in 1999.  ironically the company town of Playas was purchased by the U.S. Government for an anti-terrorism training center).  Then the closed smelter is described as being located in Mexico, and is the origin from which ""pigs"" are transported to the Tuttle Ranch on the U.S. side of the border.  Huh?

THE VERDICT
A good read in a great series, but unnecessarily confusing.

I wanted to get to the conclusion as quickly as I could to see how they would get these bad guys. Also keeping me reading until the wee hours was how the relationship between the Tribal Policeman and his old flame, the pretty young lady that was now a Border Patrol agent turned out. This one had elements of conspiracy, politics, and good old mystery. These charactors are great to revisit with every one of his books, but even if this is the first time you are meeting them, you will find them fascinating"

272,272,3,A2B1GZIRD6W646,0002005263,David W. Nicholas,"Among the various detective novelists writing today, Tony Hillerman occupies a pretty unique position. His series of detective novels, following first the adventures of two different characters, Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim Chee, in separate books. Later, Hillerman combined the two characters, and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now. He's added supporting characters, including a series of girlfriends for Chee, a wife who died and then a lady friend for Leaphorn, and colleagues like the inimitable Cowboy Dashee, who's appeared in the background of several of the books.

This latest entry in the series isn't the strongest, but it is interesting. Someone's been killed on the Reservation, and before anyone can investigate, the FBI shows up and closes down the investigation, announcing the improbably verdict of ""hunting accident"". Chee doesn't buy the explanation, and both he and Leaphorn take to investigating on their own. Meanwhile, a former colleague of theirs, Bernadette Manuelito, has gone to work for the Border Patrol. While there, she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the Reservation that Chee and Leaphorn are running.

I enjoyed this book well enough. It's not Hillerman's best, but it's a good story and reasonably well done."
273,273,5,AUFJI068IDTGD,0002005263,Kindle Customer,"Hillerman again skillfully leads his readers through convoluted mysteries while painting verbal pictures of the American West.

Just as we finally discover the name of the story's villain(s), we discover to our dismay that another journey with this authorhas ended."

So, if you like Hillerman, don't expect much from this one.  If you have not read Hillerman, don't start here - please.  He is a very good author and all of this other books are far superior to this one."
275,275,5,A1U11NS6LZ76PB,0002005263,P. Wilson,This is the first book I read of Hillerman's and I loved it.  I have started at the beginning of this delightful series and Hillerman does not disappoint.  Great read.
276,276,2,APV3V9NAXCPFI,0002005263,Mike Blyth,"The best I can say is the audio book kept me awake on a long drive. The book barely resembles the early Hillerman ones I remember, and is sort of a mix of generic Crichton-Grisham political/crime suspense with a little romance and a little New Mexico flavor thrown in for old-times sake."
277,277,2,A2XGVXP3RVV9SJ,0002005263,Richard and Carmen,"My overall impression was that this book could have been written from the script of a made-for-TV movie. Maybe visually--with rugged scenery and good looking actors--this story could have been a way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy night, but as a book worth reading it comes up lacking. In particular, the villains are second-rate and only do villainous things when it suits the author's purposes. Then, the  number of proper nouns used per page is probably second only to the Bible, owing to the naming of many extraneous characters and places.

This book is okay for reading on a long train ride or a stay in the hospital, but it is not one you'd recommend or long remember."

281,281,4,A1D6PWUMDY9F7V,0002005263,CC Coach Mike,"I had not read Mr. Hillerman in awhile. I was on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and ran out of reading material. I picked up ""The Sinister Pig"" and was very glad I did! It felt like I had returned to some old friends (Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn). The plot involves murder, oil, drugs,  and politics. A great, quick read."
282,282,1,A1JYERR10WFM3O,0002005263,Carl Koestner,"I have read most of Mr. Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn books and enjoyed all of them, even the early ones that lacked the depth of his later works, but this book left me cold.  Every character of worth Hillerman created had to have spot in this book, and many didn't fit well.  This was too contrived to hold interest."
283,283,3,A19GHRM6YUX0HV,0002005263,Phillip I. Good,"As an on-the-mark political rant on the theft of Indian oil monies, drug smuggling, failure of the drug laws to reduce drug use, success of drug laws to maintain prices of illegal drugs, poltical influence on and misuse of federal agencies,one won't find better.  Both as a novel and as a mystery, this harlequin romance is Hillerman's worst."
284,284,3,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,0002005263,LF,"The ""sinister pig"" in this story is not just a machine used in pipelines.  That would be pretty meaningless to us.  Our sinister pig is the story's villain, sinister because he will kill anyone to further his goals, and a pig because, wealthy that he is, he never has enough.

He is a very safe villain.  Everybody can hate him.  He's a politically correct villain.  Some rich pig who is greedy as can be, and murderous.  What's not to hate?

This was my first Hillerman story, so I was not at all familiar with any of the characters.  There isn't one character in this story that I feel compelled to read more about.  I'm not rushing to find another Hillerman story.

I didn't read the book.  I listened to the audio book while at work.  I'm always appreciative of someone reading a story to me while I'm stuck at work.  I can't sit behind my desk and read.

The opening of the book is a shocker.  We are introduced to a nearly retired CIA agent.  He is, apparently, the star of the book.  But no, he's not.  Boom, he's gone.

The rest of the story has to play out without the main character.  It is one of the oddest structured books I've ever come across.  The first character, the one who dominated the first chapter, is gone.  Bye.  See ya.  Now on to someone else.

And there is no star after him.  There is a handful of co-stars.  I'm not used to that.  This is very unique in that regard.  Normally, a story has a star.  This one doesn't.

One drawback with being read to is that we are dependent on the person reading, and we have to listen to him do all the characters.  I don't understand why they don't have a group of people reading, each taking one character.  I'm tired of hearing the guy say ""He said"" over and over.  I'm even more tired of hearing a male voice portray a female character by changing to a really horrible imitation of a female voice.  Couldn't they hire a woman to read with him?  We hear the guy talk in a higher voice.  It is very poorly done.  What else is he going to do?  He can't make himself sound anything like a woman.

There is only one interesting character in this story.  He is an employee of the sinister pig.  It falls to him to execute innocent girls.  The story progresses in the most expected way.  I could have written parts of the story line.  It is so obvious.  Is this good guy actually going to murder the girls?  Somehow I doubt it.  Are the good guys going to win in the end?  Yeah, I kind of think they will.

So that's the lowdown on this book.  The people who rated it five stars were overrating it, and the people who rated it one star were underrating it, and you've just read the most definitive and accurate review you'll find on this website."
285,285,5,A2K9XJ1ND1343O,0002005263,Sandra E. Harnagel,Hillerman is at his best again. This will keep you turning pages until you reach the last page. Hillerman's style is evident and welcomed.
286,286,1,AQWPR35GQAC6A,0002005263,Wren,"I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance.

The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.

All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.

And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned."
287,287,1,A1E7G56OX03JKO,0002005263,Ranch Girl,"If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published."

A good read."
289,289,5,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,0002005263,MRD,"PORK ANYONE!

THE SINISTER PIG by Tony Hillerman combines all of that you have come to expect from a classic Hillerman mystery.  It's all there: murder, intrigue, ominous messages from ""The Man,"" political maneuvering and corruption. And, as usual, it's all set against the sweeping panoramas of the American Southwest, as vivid in Hillerman's descriptions as in a Maynard Dixon painting.

Chee and Leaphorn are at there very best when a body turns up in their jurisdiction.  Step by step, the pair untangle the deftly woven webs of deceit placed carefully to ensnare the curious while covering up one of the slickest crimes the two have ever encountered. Bernie Manuelito and Cowboy Dashee are along for the rollicking ride!

290,290,4,A3ABJR7AHYSJYM,0002005263,Laura Gompertz,"I'm not sure if most Hillerman fans will like this, but I enjoyed it. I enjoyed how Hillerman has been stringing out the Bernie/Jim non-romance across several books, and how Leaphorn has become involved with Louisa. Jim has fallen away from his dreams of being a singer, let's hope Bernie can set him back on that path in the future. (Didn't we all know she was the right girl for him?)The mystery was good, and I especially like the bad guys, Budge and the Colonel were interesting. But, I was left wondering about the missing tribal money... Also, Hillerman doesn't really write women as well as his men. Bernie seened to be the damsel in distress, (ho hum) but with a little more writing, could be seen to be a young woman struggling with what she wants to do with her life and finding meaning; reality is we don't always find our true callings at first. I would have liked Hillerman to explore more about Navaho perspectives on male/female relationships, and their customs and beliefs regarding them. Would definitely like to see something happen for Leaphorn, whose name should be Legendary Lonely Leutenant Leaphorn...Louisa is sleeping in the next room... maybe she'd marry him if he would show some interest in having more than just a companion. Can he ever get over Emma? It's an ok read, but I longed for more Navaho flavor."
291,291,3,A2LVI17XQ5EYQ0,0002005263,Renee Aubuchon,"I have enjoyed Hillerman's novels for many years.  His strength is writing about the Navajo community and making Native American culture integral to plot resolution.  It is great when I can enjoy a light mystery novel and feel I have learned something about a culture I am not very familiar with.  I have counted on his accuracy since he seems to have the endorsement of the Navajo community to represent their culture in his books.  This book, with emphasis on Washington, a few mentions of Homeland Security and Osama bin Laden, takes him away from where I perceive his strengths to be.

His characters always seem to lack depth.  They seem to exist to move the plot along.  It would be great if he could write one of these books wherein he explores the inner life of some of his characters in a sustained, deep and meaningful way."
292,292,4,A11M98R135HMSY,0002005263,Paul Skinner,"Leaphorn, Chee and Bernie romp all over New Mexico in this tale involving a heavy handed Washington bureaucrat with too much power under his belt.  Bernie snaps some photos at a ranch near the Mexican border, and soon her life is in danger.  Meanwhile, Chee and Bernie can't seem to admit they love each other, and Chee wants Bernie back off the border patrol and back into the Navajo Tribal Police where she belongs.

If you like J.A. Jance's Joanna Brady series, you will love this one.  It also has a touch of Clive Cussler's style in it."
293,293,4,A912C7977MO6O,0002005263,Smallchief,"This is one of Tony Hillerman's weakest mysteries, but it's worth reading for a plot twist that will make it interesting for long-term Hillerman fans.

I suggest, as others have, that you first read several of the earlier books in the series to get to know Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, the Navajo detectives who surely deserve a place in the hall of fame for fictional detectives.  You won't be able to appreciate fully this book without being familiar with the back story.

Contrary to Hillerman's usual practice, most of the action in this book takes place off the Navajo reservation, way down in the New Mexico bootheel near the Mexican border. Hillerman's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent.  Hillerman also preaches in this novel, a bit unusual for him.  He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues.

Smallchief"
294,294,1,AWJ2DKOPN7P3W,0002005263,James MacGregor,"The wonderfulness of Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn stories has been the richness of their Navaho/Four Corners detail, the sensitivity of his characterizations, and the subtlety of the mysteries he unfolds. Now, suddenly, we have kindergarten plotting, cartoon characters, and, unbelievably, clunky, almost amateurish writing. Even the best of them produce a turkey one in a while, and I guess this is Hillerman's. Let's hope he's back on form next time."
295,295,3,A25CD3NNU10FXA,0002005263,David Sewell,"It's a little ironic that Hillerman made his reputation as a chronicler of Din (Navajo) characters and culture, but tends to put other tribes in his novels as local color elements. I was interested to see Tohono O'odham characters in Sinister Pig, but disappointed when it became obvious that Hillerman knows little or nothing about the O'odham. They're not ""locals"" in the SE Arizona / New Mexico bootheel region any more than Navajo or Hopi are. He has Jim Chee think, ""That tribe had its reservation on the Mexican border, lapping over into Arizona"". Jeesh! Look at a map, Tony: the Tohono O'odham reservation, about the size of Connecticut, is right smack in Arizona southwest of Tucson. (Lots of O'odham live in Sonora, but not on designated reservation land.)

Minor point? Yes, in terms of the novel overall. No, in terms of Hillerman's reputation as an amabassador of Native culture to a broader readership."
296,296,2,A2XWOJX3RV4PLW,0002005263,Marissa Rodriguez,"I am a big fan of all mystery and crime novels, so naturally I went out to get this book.  I was sadly disappointed, and almost regret my purchase.  There wasn't the usual umph I feel from his novels.  I do have one spark of good that came out of this.  I took the chance on a new author, I bought her book and loved it.  It was ""Waves of Deceit"" by Marlene de Velasco.  I would read that one again over this anyday."
297,297,1,A2Q3D3CC9HT0S5,0002005263,BlueDog,"I'm a big fan of his, and I have to say that this was a BIG letdown. It features: Stilted dialogue, no character development, no suspense, no description of Indian tradition and poor editing.

Avoid at all costs."
298,298,1,A4CGCU0FQFKTA,0002005263,Don V,i wouldn't bother with this one.  it is a crashing bore.  hillerman has been on a slide the past few years.  he has reached bottom.
299,299,4,A11F0ECHMYDWIN,0002005263,joedriver252,"Tony Hillerman is such an accomplished writer, it's understandable that some reviewers are somewhat disappointed by this effort.  Hillerman does an excellent job of presenting details of American Indian culture without resorting to the preachy tone some ""politically correct"" authors would use, and these details are missed in this novel.  This novel also seems to lack some of the plot twists of some of Hillerman's earlier works-it winds up reading more like a straightforward crime story than the mysteries Hillerman has created in the past. These criticisms aside, I enjoyed the novel.  It's a quicker read than some of Hillerman's earlier works, yet it still throws in a couple of twists. The characters Hillerman has created are interesting, and it's enjoyable to read another novel involving them.  In short, the novel has its faults, but on balance I enjoyed it, and I look forward to reading Hillerman's new novel soon."
300,300,4,A2PR7D7O1DY10I,0002005263,Matt Hampton,I've read some of his other books. This one was good...but not his best effort.
301,301,1,AQ55H30MZSV0Q,0002005263,J. A. Lefcourte,"An interesting plot but all of Hillerman's strengths, careful delineation of place and characters is absent. Any characters from any author could fill the roles. Is someone writing for Hillerman now? I won't pay money for any further novels by this author until his writing improves.

A shame because his early novels are among my favorites."
302,302,1,A1WRXACOKPITBQ,0002005263,Leiah@soireadthisbooktoday,"I normally enjoy Mr. Hillerman's works, and have a collection I like to return to over and over. This one, sadly, went straight into the box to go to the used book store. The editing was so horrible as to be a joke. It makes one wonder if his writing has always been this bad, and some UberEditor has been working magic for all these years, or if he was just under a huge rush to meet contractual obligations and couldn't be bothered to actually write a decent book.

It is also disappointing in that the story could have been exceptional, given a bit of care. This is an important issue to all the tribes, but should be just as important as a history lesson to all Americans as an indicator of just how corrupt the American government was in the past, and remains today.

Next time, I will take a little trip to the library before I automatically add the next Hillerman novel to my collection."
303,303,2,AA0OOIGP5MQ6D,0002005263,J. Campbell,This book comes nowhere near the quality of most of Hillerman's work. It fails to generate interest or suspense and the relationship between Chee and Manuelito is ridiculous.
304,304,1,A16NGVGUH407ZO,0002005263,Ziggy Finn,"I have been a faithful and avid follower of Mr. Hellerman's books not so much for the mystery as for the interest in lore and traditions, beliefs, syntax of the the various indian tribes of the American Southwest. An opportunity to actually be invited into the indian everyday world nicely intertwined with the fluff of the mystery. Anticipating each new story, the only mystery to me here is...who wrote this pale facsimile...surely not Mr. Hellerman. Or if he is infact the creator, he missed badly on this one. I felt a similar shadow of doubt with Skelton Man and can only hope Mr. Hellerman's next offering will be back on track! A Hillerman mystery without the indian stuff"" generously mixed in,is well, just a pulp mystery."
305,305,1,A231J4UZ1YEUQ0,0002005263,A reader,"I agree with the reviewer who said 'read the others first'. Apart from the great spaces of the American Southwest, there's very little that's typically Hillerman here. Please Mr. Hillerman, stick with the various Amerindian cultures of the region - they're fascinating - give us more interplay & inter-reaction!"
306,306,3,A7X1H9HQFGBII,0002005263,Kindle Customere,"I love Tony Hillerman's books, but this one is a major disappointment. I have always found his descriptions of the Navaho culture and the lives of the characters to be very interesting with unique situations that distinguish him from the usual run-of-the-mill mystery writer. Substitute the character's names with any Anglo or Hispanic names, and you would not recognize this as a Hillerman book.

I was sorry to see that Bernie's character devolve from a strong woman officer to the lady-in-distress rescued by the hero, and eager to become the little woman after all. I was also sorry that Jim seems to be losing interest in becoming a healer.

They story was interesting and well written, if a bit of a stretch, but just not what I look for in a Hillerman book."
307,307,2,A34Y4CN9FADTB7,0002005263,Daniel N. Copp,"Reading Tony Hillerman's latest, I was at first thrilled by the congregation of old friends - Jim, Joe, Bernie, Cowboy et al - and a return to the delightfully atmospheric Four Corners.  Then not too many pages further, my elation was undermined by a pathetically weak plot, a non-dimensional villan and female victim, and a rush to the totally predictable and maudlin denouemont.  Let's hope that Tony finds a second wind; these characters and northern New Mexico are too good to waste on a comic book story."
308,308,3,A3NHI94FA6ME71,0002005263,D. Kralis,"Once again Tony lays out another vivid picture of New Mexico's enchanting lanscape. but this time the setting is the mysterious and lonely desert area of NM's boot heel.

The characters are there. For the most part it reads like a typical Hillerman Leaphorn/Chee book but with an exception. The story is hurried along after a few chapters. It's like someone was bored and wanted to get the manuscript to the publishers quick and be done with it. All true Hillerman fans will read this book but I believe most will feel a bit cheated. It's a very short read even for a Hillerman.

The beginning starts out with a perplexing and strange murder to solve but everything is unraveled quickly. I pretty much knew what to expect next from each character. The perfect chance to build suspense and a deep mystery was wasted by letting Joe Leaphorn solve everything way too quickly. It seems Joe only needs a few phone calls and a simple map to solve anything. The usually savy Chee and his intellegent cohort gal, now with another agency, are like bafoons relying mostly on the aging legendary Leaphorn to figure everything out.

If you're a diehard Leaphorn/Chee fan like I am, you'll buy the book, even with its dissapointing 'not up to par' story.

If it's your first one in the series, do yourself a huge favor. Read the first 15 before taking this one on. Otherwise you'll miss out on how good Hillerman can really be and might never bother to read the others."
309,309,4,A2KSU7OOJ5C479,0002005263,Loren D. Morrison,"I, like many of the other reviewers here, am a long standing fan of Tony Hillerman's mysteries featuring Joe ""The Legendary Lieutenant"" Leaphorn and Jim Chee.  I, also like many other reviewers, found __THE SINISTER PIG__ to be a compelling mystery.
It carries through many themes from earlier Hillerman mysteries:  We have Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, who is in love with Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito, formerly of the Tribal Police, but now with the Border Patrol.  Chee is afraid to tell her of his feelings for fear of rejection.  We have the aforementioned Bernadette Manuuelito who is in love with Jim Chee, but also is afraid to express her love due to the same fear.  We have the now retired ""legendary Lieutenant"" with his ever-present maps and his analytical mind.  It's always a pleasure to meet these three again.
We have a powerful businessman/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.  We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man.
Throw all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things.
Well, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels.  In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites.  I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery.  This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.
Even with the unique aspect of his writing missing, __THE SINISTER PIG__ is a novel worth reading."
310,310,2,A3HDLAZUZH8QWF,0002005263,Louis E. Bridges,"I love Tony Hillerman.  I have read every book he has written including all his Chee/Leaphorn books, his children's book, his coffee table book, his memoir, his non-fiction books, etc.  I even liked ""Finding Moon"".  Having said this, his last several Chee/Leaphorn books are delivering a diminishing return of enjoyment.  ""The Sinister Pig"" is an acceptable novel but without question the worst Chee/Leaphorn book to date. The books feel particularly strained in how Hillerman tries to bring all of the series characters (Chee, Leaphorn and Bernie) together in unlikely and implausible ways despite their natural separation by age, jobs and hundreds of miles.  What I most enjoy about Hillerman are his steady pacing, sense of the environment and interweaving of Navajo and western culture.  All of this is present in this novel.  What is missing is carefully plotting and crisp dialogue."
311,311,4,A1IIGIXBH9NX4J,0002005263,quietstorm,"I've read all his books. I found this a quick enjoyable read. I'll admit the captivating imagery of the 4 corners area that Hillerman created in earlier books is missing, but I still liked the book. It drew me in and got me emotionally involved. The story was actually more interesting to me than some of the stories in his more highly regarded books, including some of those which had that magical imagary that this book is missing. If you're a fan, you should read it coz you'll probably like the story."
312,312,1,AJAPKRSNE6YIP,0002005263,Linda Day,"I've read all of Hillerman's books, and this one is a major disappointment. It reads like a very rough first draft, a plot sketch. If you pay attention to the bewildering number of characters, the plot plods resolutely forward, no surprises -- and none of the intricate twists that Hillerman has dazzled us with in previous books. The characters are thinly developed (so-o-o-o little tension between major love interests) and seldom manage to rise above pot-boiler level. Unlike his other books that take place on the reservation, there is no interesting information about native Americans, their history, culture, etc. About the only thing this book CAN claim to do is keep you turning the pages. You keep believing that surely the real Tony Hillerman will appear to delight you. Alas, he's asleep at the wheel. It's a shame to see such a talent settle for so little.
I am one disappointed fan."

Guidall who does an excellent job. Many of the other reviewers tell you the plot so I will just give you my impression. I thoroughly enjoyed the book keeping in mind I have read several other books with the characters of Chee and Leaphorn. I liked the suspense and timing of this book. I have no problem with
Bernie being shaken by her ordeal. I really liked the element of Budge's part in the drama and I especially liked the ending."
314,314,1,A2HB2UG12Y9TJ3,0002005263,PAUL A. Thompson,"I first read Mr. Hillerman in 1973 or so.  I enjoyed his wonderful blend of Navajo atmosphere and crime.
He has been straying.  As he gets off the rez, his books lose their impetus.  This book is a great example.  Very little to do with Navajo interaction with the larger culture.  A lot to do with a pretty silly plot.  At many points in the book, I found myself re-reading it, trying to figure out how X happened, as it seems to have been edited very slackly as well.
Can't recommend this book, unfortunately."
315,315,4,A2VZ11U5DXM8J5,0002005263,C. Ebeling,"I gave THE SINISTER PIG 4 stars because, hey, it's part of a good series with very likeable characters and it is a page turner.  However, on other accounts it is lacking.  The strength of the Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn mysteries has been character and cultural setting.  This time out, the story is plot-driven and largely takes place off the Four Corners Navajo reservation.  Much time is spent on the ""guest star"" characters and not so much on our old friends.  Thus, there is a thinness to this book despite a plot that starts off ambitiously snuffling up Washington corruption, post 9-11 paranoia, corrupt CEOs, drug smuggling, and other zeitgeist.
The good news is, those who have read earlier entries in the series will be amused to find all of the other regulars finally losing patience with Jim Chee's romantic klutziness and variously taking him aside and essentially saying, look here, the time has come to get on with things.  Also, Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy.  There is a great scene where the FBI, New Mexico State Police, Bureau of Land Management, DEA, and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security, insisting on authority over everything and everybody.
A last comment: the hardcover edition is riddled with publishing errors, mostly misplaced punctuation.  Isn't proofreading on editorial job descriptions anymore?"

Sibley,"""Carl Mankin"" a sort of nom de guerre is supposed to go to the four corners and find out how the pipeline system is bypassed to avoid paying royalties to the Interior Department for the Indians.  The man has just retired from the CIA.  His employer is named Slate.  The amount not accounted for may be as high as forty billion.  Mankin is afraid he will stand out as he did not stand out in the Mideast when in the petroleum producing areas.
Mankin checks with the Department of Energy. A sort of target has been identified, Rowley Winsor, a sinister pig, who may have political connections.  Winsor's grandfather made his money in liquor during Prohibition.  Winsor's character is illustrated by the fact that he has arranged to have a  Congressional intern killed because her pregnancy is an inconvenience to him.
Jim Chee and FBI Agent Osborne learn that a dead man has been identified through the Visa card of Carl Mankin.  The Carl Mankin credit card is in the possession of Delbert Chinosa who received it from Albert Desboti.  Albert Desboti found the card in a billfold while cleaning a park.  A renatal automobile has alson surfaced miles away from the body and the wallet.
Joe Leaphorn, retired, is contacted by Chee and others seeking to unravel the identity and the goals of the dead man.  Jim Chee finds a tie-in with information Bernadette Manuelito, a Customs Officer and his former employee, has discovered.  He drives south to see her.  It seems tht the dead man is really Gordon Stein.  Both the FBI and the CIA as his former employer and other forces are withholding pertinent information.  Bernadette Manuelito is in physical danger for having stumbled upon and photographed scenes yielding clues to the solution of the mystery.
Fortunately Leaphorn and Chee come to the realization of the danger on time to be of assistance.  The plotting is adroit. The characters, as always, are well drawn.  The theme of the series may very well be Jim Chee's search for a mate."
317,317,2,A2AG0DBDIQ7JOK,0002005263,P. Royalty,"I think the author needed to flesh out his bank account, and so Hillerman fans will be disappointed at this novelette.  All the depth of knowledge and depth of plot one cherishes in the other Chee/Leaphorn adventures is missing.
A quick pleasant read, with a predictable plot, but don't expect more than that.  The reader does learn a tad about Chee's vapid relationship to women, but even that is thinly treated, and it plays out foreseeably.  This is not a Hillerman novel I will re-read. Glad I found it at the library, it will not be put on my own shelves."
318,318,4,A1DBDFV1K52ANB,0002005263,Douglas Pass,"The charm of Hillerman's books is the place and the people. The familiar characters are here in a slightly different setting, though I think his books with Jim Chee or Joe Leaphorn are stronger than those with both characters. Hillerman's stories have their own pace, and this one like others moves along leisurely to a fast finish. The plot is clever, and reprises Hillerman's themes of corrupt Easterners and Byzantine law enforcement agencies. It's a good read.
  The edition I read, though, was the single worst proof-read book I have ever encountered, beginning with the author's forward. The publisher should have been embarrassed to release it."
319,319,2,A3G2JYXEW059CY,0002005263,Michael B. Scott,"For years, Tony Hillerman has been giving us wonderful plots, intricate characters and breathtaking verbal landscapes. With ""The Sinister Pig,"" unfortunately, it seems Mr. Hillerman is growing tired of his Leaphorn/Chee series.
  The plot of ""The Sinister Pig,"" his latest in the series, is promising, but Hillerman seems to have lacked either the energy or the desire to flesh it out into what could have been a fantastic novel. Instead, what we get is a partially realized concept that clocks in at an anemic 240 pages. (And it's 240 heavily padded pages, at that, with blank pages between chapters, large type and heavy leading on the part of the typesetter. Let's face it: This is more a novella masquerading as a novel than the real thing.)
  The book is also rife with proofing errors, including more missing question marks than one can count and at least one instance in which he accidentally refers to Chee as Leaphorn in mid-scene. That, plus a far-from-satisfying closing, makes ""The Sinister Pig"" feel like a rush job, as if Hillerman was more interesting in finishing this project quickly than crafting a quality piece.
  Fans of Mr. Hillerman's work have come to expect much more, and they all know he's capable of top-notch fiction. Unfortunately, ""The Sinister Pig"" doesn't fit that category."
320,320,3,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,0002005263,Jayson Olson,"Over the many novels in Hillerman's illustrious career, the readers have come to love the adventures of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, however, the Sinister Pig seems to delve off onto a parallel tangent of the mysteries we've read for so long.
While both characters are present, it seems as if Hillerman wanted to introduce something else besides yet another murder mystery, that is a little political commentary of his own.  The novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the Indian Nations as it ties into oil profits and the U.S. government.  While I don't dispute his claims one way or another, Sinister Pig clearly is a vehicle for Hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this.
The story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of Navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from Hillerman.  Gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the Native Americans.  Instead we find Jim Chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former Officer Bernie Manuelito.
Joe Leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  And while Leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal.
However, who does step up to the plate is Bernie Manuelito.  Now as a Border Patrol Officer assigned to lower New Mexico, she stumbles across a corrupt department, and some 'fishy' on-goings at the nearby Tuttle Ranch.  Something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant U.S. government.
The novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.  Chapters are small and to the point.  It was a good diversion for a Hillerman book, but I hope this was just a half way point to a much larger novel that will bring our characters back to the forefront of Native American culture and its roots in northern New Mexico."
321,321,4,ASB1VI8NQRY61,0002005263,John Harrison,"This is actually more of an agglomeration of more or less related short stories than a real mystery book with a central plot and a few sub-plots. While Hillerman has done this before and usually does this very well, this is not his best effort.  It would not be a good book to start reading Hillerman, you need to know the characters to understand some of the allusions.
One of the reasons I read Hillerman is his intimate acquaintanceship with a place and a people that I find interesting and yet know very little about.  Usually he obliges by adding to my small store of knowledge about the southwest or Navajo life.  This time the additions, and there were some, were very small.  Hillerman needs to get back into Chee or Leaphorn and then write a story.  This is when he is at his best - but he is still very good."
322,322,4,ANEDXRFDZDL18,0002005263,Serene Night,"I really liked sinister pig, with the exception of  the characterization of Bernie Manuelito, who I felt was short-changed somewhat. In this book, Bernie has decided to work for Border Patrol, out of frustration with her ex-boss Jim Chee, who has been a bit stand-offish. Instead of being satisfied with her new position, Bernie yearns for the rez and  her friends. Jim Chee, meanwhile, is miserable without Bernie, but helpless as to how to express his growing affection
I admit, I was a bit disappointed with the character development of Bernie Maneulito, who is my favorite character. Why must Jim Chee and the other male characters constantly rescue her? Bernie is a well-trained police officer and no longer a rookie! I was disapointed that the author chose to portray such a strong female character as a frail wilting flower, who just needed one of the men to help her out. Feh. It would be nice for Bernie to rescue Jim Chee for a change.
Overall, a good book, with an interesting villian. But please, I'm a bit tired of the author selling Bernie short. What's wrong with Bernie being a cop? The book needs a few tough women to balance out the mostly-male cast."
323,323,5,A1NIJN65YPFUR1,0002005263,J. M. Stanley,"I read The Sinister Pig a few months ago and was really impressed with it. I think that Mr. Hillerman is climbing back up to his former status as the best southwestern mystery writer. His last few books haven't been as good as his older ones, but this book was great. It had everything that made his old books so great and more. I can't wait until his next one."
324,324,5,AQ40L2YGV7C42,0002005263,FictionAddiction.NET,"In this latest book of several - the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee series - a well dressed corpse is found near the Jicarilla Apache Indian reservation without identification or visible means of transportation.
Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is dispatched to the scene and caught up in a spiral of intrigue and white man's avarice and greed. Here is an authentic tribal setting that is engaging in its freshness and ring of truth; this is a mystery of riveting vigor.
Sgt. Jim Chee and retired Joe Leaphorn combine forces once again to sort and tie a variety of clues into a satisfying conclusion to the story. Along the way, as an essential part of the story, Jim resolves his interest in former NTP office Bernie Manuelito.
From the scandal at the Department of Interior concerning a missing four or forty billion dollars of Indian Trust money to the capitol of the United States, this tale grabs and holds the reader.
Here's suspense, greed, avarice, theft, murder, love and the wide open American Southwest wrapped up in a tidy bundle of reader enjoyment. This is Tony Hillerman as good as he has ever been and hopefully will continue."
325,325,3,AYNLD5B9OKL0F,0002005263,Thelma C. Johnson,"I have read all of Tony Hillerman's books, and have learned a great deal about the Navajo people and their culture.  I think I enjoy the descriptions of setting and folkways more than the plots of his books.  This one was short on description of sky and mountains and weather.  Hillerman seems to have decided that since he has written so much of Navajo ceremonies and the nature of the people, that he doesn't have to tell us any more.  I felt a great lack of what I enjoy most.  I also felt that the book lurched along from an unprepossessing start in Washington D. C. through a series of events that never quite explained everything.  I expected more to be said of the ripoff of royalties for gas and oil, because it seemed to be introduced as an important problem early on.  This won't stop me from reading the next thing Hillerman writes, but I hope the next one is more organic in structure and contains the old poetic quality when he writes of the people and the land."
326,326,3,A9GEHD37Z90HT,0002005263,Dean Markwardt,"First, you should know I'm a big Tony Hillerman fan. I have read all his Four Corners novels. I have sought out other books by him, including travel guides. I have taken a special interest in Hillerman interviews. My wife is equally devoted. It was partly because of Hillerman that we have made three trips to Navajo country.
His books have always been well crafted, I think, with tight, intriguing plots. I don't think there has been one I wasn't anxious to finish, to find out the who, how, and why. But that isn't what makes Hillerman books special. Tony Hillerman has taken us inside the Navajo culture, revealing its history, its customs, its religious traditions. He has shown us the divisions and ambivalence that exist within that world, between those who revere and practice the old ways and those who would reject or suppress them. He has shown us the subtle but important differences between the Navajo and the Hopi and Zuni and other tribes. He has done all this with the utmost respect.
Tony Hillerman has also captured the land. His descriptions of the mountains, the canyons, the vast isolation, are magnificent. On our first trip to New Mexico, we went to Shiprock as though on a pilgrimage. We bought a copy of the Triple-A Indian Country map and followed rugged roads. It was deja vu. We were convinced that Mr. Hillerman knew and loved every square mile of that vast country as well as any Jim Chee.
But I'm talking about the first nine novels. Something has happened with the last three (or is it four? I may have lost count) that I don't understand. There seems to be a blandness to it all now. I don't feel the intimacy with the country or the people. The visions of mesas and mountains no longer soar. The plots are ok, I guess, but the rest of it is, well, kind of dull.
I read in an interview that Mr. Hillerman had intended to finish the series with nine books. Three featuring Joe Leaphorn, three with Jim Chee, and three with both. Now I wonder. Did Tony Hillerman stop with nine? Is someone writing for him now? Is the pressure to publish so great that a ghost writer has assumed responsibility for the last several novels? Or, more dreadful possibility, is Tony Hillerman unable to write anymore? I understand he has battled cancer. I pray that illness is not preventing him from authoring his own material.
My guess is that Mr. Hillerman is still coming up with plot ideas and the basic structure of his novels, but that some other person or persons is supplying the word count. How else to explain the difference? Where has the magic gone?"
327,327,4,ALA15X444CMOU,0002005263,Linda One,"Bernie Manulito (sp?) and Cowboy Dashee have joined the ranks of federal law enforcement officers and both figure prominently in this story.  In a less gifted author, it would all seem too convenient but Hillerman's writing is seamless.
  Bernie has taken another job to get away from Jim Chee and what she perceives to be his ambivalence toward her.  As a border patrol agent, she stumbles across some illegal activity which places her danger.  This danger gives her an opportunity for more action in the book and gives Jim a reason to seek her out.
  Meanwhile Jim Chee is miserable without her but does not know what to do about it.  Both Joe Leaphorn and Cowboy Dashee become involved in the mystery, and the people who pose the biggest threat to Bernie are taken down in the end.  There is a pleasant surprise in the take-down scene.
  This was a delightful story that goes by much too quickly.  It seems shorter than his other novels, but I liked it much more than the last one he wrote.  I only gave it four stars because he has written other novels I like more that I would give five stars to, but taken by itself and not in comparison with his other novels, I'd give it five stars.
  Hillerman is by far one of the best novelists of our time.  I dread the thought of his last book and with every new book, I fear it will be his last.  I have learned a great deal about Navajo history, culture and religion from his books while having a good time with the mysteries therein."
328,328,3,A1GPKEWSZGUEEP,0002005263,audiobook maven,"Tony Hillerman falls off his stride when he attempt to plot a story around high-falutin' eastern types.  But how can any story that features Joe Leaphorn and his magical maps--even if only tangentially--fail to enchant a listener?  The final compilation is not Hillerman's best, but it is still a whole lot better than a whole lot else out there.  The audio version is wonderfully read by Geroge Guidall."
329,329,3,AVCK48WHU7Q4T,0002005263,Hubies Brother,"I eagerly await each new Hillerman book spotlighting the compelling duo of Native American lawmen Leaphorn and Chee. The author has defined these two in a low-key, nicely detailed manner that makes them compelling and comfortable, story after story. Why, oh why does Hillerman keep his appealing heroes offstage for so long in this latest outing? He continually cuts away from the good guys to focus on the bad guys, who are uninteresting and mundane.
I've devoured every Leaphorn/Chee mystery, and am sad to report that this is by far the weakest. But onward and upward, Mr. Hillerman. Bring on some more."
330,330,5,A34PUH7KNZ9HCJ,0002005263,John Thomson,"The Sinister Pig (2003) is the most recent installment of Tony Hillerman's series of mystery novels set in and around the Four Corners area of the Southwestern United States. It is another superb novel, and nearly on par with his other works. The Sinister Pig offers many characters familiar to  Hillerman's readers. Jim Chee continues to be a main focus, as does his prospective love interest, Bernadette Manuelito, now a novice customs officer working in southern New Mexico. Manuelito stumbles into trouble, drawing Chee and a host of others into the picture.
Not the least of these others is the ""legendary"" ex-Captain Joe Leaphorn and his new ""sidekick"" character, Dr. Bourbonet. Several new characters - a Guatemalan exile, a Washington DC attorney and an erstwhile law student -- are particular to this story. Still, they're well-written and compelling, and extend the depth of the story past the usual boundaries of a mystery. As the story develops, the reader will notice a series of evolutionary departures from Hillerman's standard fare.
Foremost among these is the fact that story reads less like a mystery than a suspense novel. While it's true that there is a murder, and it is something of a mystery, the good guys and the bad guys all have their identities and roles out on the table pretty early on in the book. From there, the reader gets to anticipate whether the good guys (Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and a few others) will find and capture the bad guys before they succeed in any of their nefarious plans. Since the reader knows how the pieces fit together before the characters, the story really revolves around the suspense, rather than the ""whodunit"" aspect of the plot.
At the same time, some other changes seem to be brewing in Hillerman's writing. First, while Hillerman has always shifted points of view frequently in his stories, it seems like no point of view is particularly dominant in this book. From my recollection, that's a little different than in his earlier writing. Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and three major characters particular to this book all get some time in front of the point-of-view lens. It doesn't hamper the story, but for those used to watching Chee or Leaphorn solve a mystery, it's a little new. The other key difference is that much of this novel takes place off the Navajo reservation that's so familiar to Hillerman readers. While that doesn't hamper the story either, for me it left the novel with a very different feel. Prior works were well-steeped in Navajo (and sometimes Hopi) cultural flavor, and I enjoyed this aspect of his works. That flavor, for me, got largely crowded out by other story elements in this book. It didn't ruin the work, but I did find that I missed that content, and hope he returns to it in the future.
Far from harming the work, these differences and changes simply present the story in a different light. Sinister Pig is an excellent novel, and well lives up to the expectations that Hillerman's readers have. I give it five stars for it's strong story, good characters and compelling tempo. I don't think readers, whether they've read Hillerman before or not, could be disappointed by this  book."
331,331,3,A9L1JTFE26GLN,0002005263,Patricia Kramer,"The acknowledgements at the beginning of this book tell the reader why this book was written. Mr. Hillerman mentions ""the Department of the Interior's efforts to explain what has happened to $176,000,000 (billions!!!) of Indian oil, gas, coal, timber, etc-royalties which it can't seem to account for.""
In reading this book, it seemed as if Mr. Hillerman's outrage over this little publicized situation and his effort to call attention to it, led him to give less attention to his usual complexity of character and setting.
This book was perfect for airplane reading and may lead me to learn more about the missing royalities. It may also lead me to read ""Seldom Disappointed"" to learn more about Tony Hillerman and what makes him tick."
332,332,3,AL2VDE4LO4ESR,0002005263,Jack Fitzgerald,"As a longtime fan of Tony Hillerman's mystery series involving Navajo policemen Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, and now Bernie Manuelito, I picked this one up based purely on name recognition. As I read the book, however, I began to wonder if it had actually been written by Hillerman.
The plot involves Washington, D.C. politicos involved in drug-running between Mexico and the U.S. There is some soap-boxing about missing royalties owed Native American tribes from the U.S. government, and a couple honorable assassins thrown in to spice things up.
The setup is interesting enough, with a man sent out to the Four Corners region to do some investigating, shot in the back, and then a follow-up investigation by Sgt. Jim Chee. Meanwhile, Chee's would-be girlfriend has become Border Patrol Officer Manuelito down in the bootheel of New Mexico. In fact, most of the action in the story is done by Bernie, although Leaphorn figures out most of the details with his powers of deduction and a couple maps. Chee just kind of ties things together.
What disappointed me is that although the characters are moving along, the spirit seems to have gone out of Hillerman's writing. The vivid details of the landscape and geography are missing, along with the spirituality of Chee. Most of the Navajo cultural notes that made the earlier novels interesting are just kind of hinted at and it is assumed that the reader has read the other works. If this was the first Hillerman mystery I picked up, I would probably skip the rest."
333,333,3,A2XIZEBB2KS0YJ,0002005263,Richard A. Lovett,"As I read this book, the thought that kept intruding that Tony Hillerman is no longer young (he'll be 78 this year). I strongly suspect that this book, which comes so strongly on the heels of  ""The Wailing Wind,"" may well be his last.

  Other reviewers have noted that this book adds nothing new to our understanding of the central characters. But it does leave them with fewer unresolved issues than prior books. Rather than being the cynical money-making effort depicted in some reviews below, this book appears to be a parting gift from an aging author who wanted to give the series a more satisfying closure than ""The Wailing Wind"" had left us with.

That said, it's not a great stand-alone book. The first chapter, which introduces the retiring CIA agent who will soon become the murder victim, is painfully cliched, seemingly cobbled together from bad spy movies and political thrillers. The mystery is obvious (partly because huge chunks of it are told from the villains' perspective), and except for a little bit of magic with maps, Leaphorn and Chee get no chance to show off their detecting brilliance. The setting, in southern New Mexico's ""boot heel"" region, is rendered generically, without the detail for which Hillerman is famous-as though he'd written it from maps and memory. Plot elements never connect, and there are gaps in the police procedure (most notably involving a car, which is missing in one chapter but has been fingerprinted in another chapter, with no mention that I could find of its being discovered).

The cobbled-together feel of this book, its lack of complexity, and its short length make me suspect that Hillerman's health is failing and that he rushed it to completion while he still could. Hopefully I'm wrong. Regardless, readers of the series this book should save this book for last-it's merely an epilog to a long and honorable series. If you've read all the books, this one is a must read. If you've not, you'll be disappointed.

And if I'm right, thanks Tony, for making the effort to give us a parting gift."
334,334,1,A1R1K5KEF5MCIM,0002005263,Amazon Customer,"How disappointing.  Maybe Hillerman needed some fast cash and dashed off a quickie novel.  Maybe he had it ghosted.  Whatever the case, 'Sinister Pig' has none of the Hillerman hallmarks we've come to admire and expect.  Most of the action takes place away from the Navajo reservation, depriving the author of one of his most compelling characters: the reservation itself.  The Navajo people and their territory are only tangentially related to what the bad guys are up to.  The Navajo police go about their business like any other cops, without the special concerns for culture, tradition and beliefs that have been such key themes in earlier novels.  Hillerman's efforts to get his protagonists off the reservation seem strained, as if he can't quite deal with the developing Chee-Manuelito relationship in the context of Navajo mores or his earlier stories. In 'Pig', we learn nothing new about daily life on the reservation, curing ceremonies, creation myth or sacred places.  We don't get to know our favorite characters any better.  We don't feel the tension between the traditional and the modern, especially in Chee.  As a mystery, it is contrived and predictable; as a romance novel it's pretty tame.  If you're coming to Hillerman for the first time, please don't start with this one.  The earlier books are much more complex, enlightening and fun."
335,335,1,A38FPECVKD1Y15,0002005263,Harold Josephs,"Unless you are an absolutely die hard fan -- save your money.  Otherwise, this book is bound to be a disappointment.  The villain is utterly implausible, much of the plot centers in D.C. and Chee and Leaphorn are peripheral to the story. I have to say that I usually enjoy Hillerman for the descriptions of the landscape and insights into Navajo culture as much as the mystery itself.  This time, however, the plot is so implausible and the writing so flat that it detracted from the usual pleasures.  I also have to say, having lived in Washington, DC for the past 12 years, that I found the portions of the book dealing with DC and federal politics completely absurd.  In fact, Mr. Hillerman so misunderstands the DC political game and his villain is painted in such broad strokes that it made me wonder whether his descriptions of Navajo culture are equally bogus and inaccurate.  By the end of the book, I had come to question all his descriptions.
I also have to agree with all those who criticized the writing in this book.  Many of the scenes read like outlines, particularly in the later chapters.  I've noticed that mystery writers with long established series frequently get lazy with the later books in the series (see Martha Grimes), but I do not understand why the publisher or editor does not insist that sparse scenes be fleshed out and that authors adhere to modicum of versimilitude.  I know that the authors of Hillerman's stature will make money no matter how dreadful the writing but I would think the embarassment factor would kick in."
336,336,4,A2GLN2XGQ5JNWQ,0002005263,Carol Abbott,"Tony Hillerman does a bit of traveling away from the Navajo Reservation in this outing.  Officer Bernadette Manuelito has forsaken the tribal police for a job in the southern most regions of New Mexico, where she is training on the job to be a border patrol agent.  Although she is still in love with Jim Chee, she sees only hurt and complications in staying so decides to move on and find solace in her work.  Sgt. Chee is much better at police business than he is at expressing the personal stuff in his life, so poor Bernie is under the impression that the attraction she feels is never going to be reciprocated and she needs to get on with her life.
Meanwhile, back on the res, a body turns up that is causing a lot more than the usual interest by federal agents.  There is no identification on the body but the FBI immediately snatches the case from the local jurisdiction of the tribal police and all inquiries from the locals for progress in the case get a response of ""this isn't your problem.""  Of course, Jim Chee is even more curious when he starts getting that answer and begins to hunt for information on his own.
Retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn gets drawn into the same puzzle of the unidentified dead man by a different route.  As usual, he gives insight based on his considerable years on the force dealing with both criminals and the bureaucracy.
And in a final, bizarre twist, Officer Bernie (200 miles to the south of the reservation) finds a piece of the puzzle that has Jim heading down to the border for a visit and a feeble attempt at talking Bernie into coming home.  Trouble is, Chee, the great problem solver can't untangle his feelings for this beautiful Navajo girl.  Since his past relationships have always ended badly, he has no hope that this young woman just might be his perfect compliment, so unconsciously keeps pushing her away.
But, personal relationships aside, the Sinister Pig moves inexorably toward an explosive final solution, tying all the strange coincidences and loose ends into a very nicely wrapped, well planned mystery.
It all sounds complicated, but in Hillerman's deft hands, The Sinister Pig becomes completely plausible and thoroughly enjoyable."
337,337,4,A356OPC8FE82K9,0002005263,A. Farmer,"Thank goodness I didn't rely on other reviews saying that Mr. Hillerman's new book was a disappointment.  I thought it was really exciting and developed the character of Jim Chee much further.  I am one of the lucky ones who calls New Mexico home.  I nod in agreement at the descriptions of the beautiful landscapes...I get to see them every day.  If you have come to know Leaphorn and Chee through earlier books, don't miss this one!"
338,338,1,A2VKJSOFX1TIWL,0002005263,Amazon Customer,"Tony HIllerman may have started writing this book but surely he wasn't the one to finish it. The first few chapters promise another great story about our hero Chee saving the day but in the end it truns into Budge's story (one of the bad guys). Not only is it Budge who saves the lady in distress, but most of the action takes place in Badge's world.  The very end is even worst.  The last two chapters and the epilog look like they are just the writer's notes and arn't developed at all.  I'd like my money back, Mr. Hillerman."
339,339,1,AR9TE45VPVGQK,0002005263,David Gibbons,"What a disappointment. I wait for each new story that Tony Hillerman writes, hoping it will be as good as his last. Hillerman's first books were fantastic but the last several, Wailing Wind and Sinister Pig in particular, have not been up to what we expect. Sinister Pig was not good at all. It didn't even read like Hillerman. I hope he hasn't ""lost it"" as a writer. I am hoping that someone else is writing these books and he is only putting his name on the cover.  If you are interested in a writer who is getting better instead of going downhill, who writers the same kind of stories as Hillerman, try Margaret Coel."

Chee doesn't think so, but he doesn't know where to take it until he gets a letter from Bernie Manuelito--now a border patrol officer. Bernie has seen strange things on the border but when her boss takes her picture and then that picture shows up in drug runners' offices, she knows she is in trouble. She may value her independence, but she knows when she's in over her head and she is. With a little help from Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Chee untangles a mystery that involves a missing $40 billion of Bureau of Indian Affairs royalty money and the U.S./Mexico drug smuggling business. Whether he'll unravel the clues in time to save Bernie is another question.

Both men are still struggling with their love interests, unable to quite put things together, suddenly inarticulate in the presence of the women they love. THE SINISTER PIG takes the mystery largely off the reservation and so misses out on the Native American culture and religion that provides such a depth to many of Hillerman's earlier Chee and Leaphorn novels.
Hillerman is cynical about the war on drugs, recognizing that its biggest supporters include the smugglers themselves--criminals who would be out of business if drugs were legalized and who are willing to do virtually anything to prevent this disaster. As always in Hillerman novels, the FBI is treated as incompetent and corrupt at the D.C. level, even as it sends its most talented agents into the hinterland. Hillerman also takes a dig at the Department of Homeland Security, recognizing that adding a layer of bureaucracy may not be the best way to improve safety.
Hillerman's strong writing makes this short mystery a page turner. Fans will want to read it even as they hope that Hillerman will return to the Native American culture that makes many of his earlier novels so powerful."
341,341,2,A1V1B8FOFE2ZZ,0002005263,rogilman,"The shock of 9/11 pushed quite a few liberals over the edge from Yuppieism into outright conservatism.  Prominent names that come to mind are TV commentator Charlie Rose and writer Christopher Hitchens (who got an early start going after Bill Clinton).  In the Acknowledgements, Tony Hillerman whines about the U.S. Customs Service and Border Patrol being too ""...undermanned and overworked...to stem the flood across our borders..."", which makes me wonder if he, too, has joined the tide.
Certainly, nothing in this book suggests otherwise.  Its story line is superficial, with familiar characters updated rather than developed. At best, it's a poor attempt at an international crime thriller. Every book can't be great and, thus, it's tempting just to chalk this one up and look forward to the next.  However, it's hard to reconcile that apology with Hillerman's handling of officer Bernie Manuelito this time around. The author turns the smart and curious Manuelito into little more a sniveling young woman, impatiently waiting for the emotionally repressed but brave Jim Chee to come save and carry her back to the tribal lands and conjugal bliss. The book's title refers to a device used to clean gas and oil lines, but could it seen as a double entendre about the author's trajectory?"
342,342,1,A1QIHNZHUHQV08,0002005263,Susan Gardner Bowers,"I share the sentiments of my fellow reviewers - this was contrived, shallow and a total let-down.  It was as if Mr. Hillerman hired out the writing.  I am a total fan, and eagerly awaited the book.  Now I will eagerly await the next one.  I am always an optimist."
343,343,3,A3NU88ECJZ168W,0002005263,L. Coltharp,"I, like many Hillerman fans, waited anxiously for Sinister Pig.  Unfortunately, when it arrived I was disappointed.  The story has  potential, but fails to reach it.  It's like Hillerman was told write your story using only X number of words, then you're done regardless of whether the story is filled out and completed or not.  Is this the end of Chee and Leaphorn??"
344,344,4,A2K7BZAL9BB92F,0002005263,Charles J. Marr,"This novel demonstrates the spare, elegant prose and tight plot that characterizes Hillerman at his best - as in Blessing Way or Dark Wind. Then too, the characters we have come to love, Jim Chee, Joe Leaphorn and even the interloping Cowboy Dashee as well as Jim Chee's latest heartbreaker, Bernie Manuelito, are center stage. So why the grousing. Perhaps Hillerman fans expected more fireworks after the two most recent clunkers. Or maybe, with the same cast in place, readers expected Hillerman to continue his exploration and exposition of the cultures of the native peoples of the southwest. But as Hillerman moves his action further south, he leaves much of the Navaho ethos behind, and the distinct customs of a people fade as the writer brings the Sonoran landscape to the foreground. Tellingly it is described as even more vacant, more of a vacuum of living things than the ""Four Corners"" setting of earlier novels. Bernie, now with the Customs Patrol carries extra plastic jugs of water in her vehicle, and she will need them as she discovers thirsty illegals stranded in the desert. Principal characters getting lost because of undistinguishable landmarks ( unthinkable on Navaho land ) leads  more than once to important plot turns. Readers similarly may be exploring new and unfamiliar territory which is a bit more uncomfortable because of the presence of the familiar in different roles. If this is not classic Hillerman, it is still very good Hillerman, a differently focused Hillerman, and an entertaining read."
345,345,1,AO6U3C5QH8CON,0002005263,Samuel Louis,"It's quite clear that Tony Hillerman has squeezed the last ounce of blood from this turnip. You know he's run out of ideas for his venerable Native American heroes when he's more interested in the villains of the book than the cops.
This book, definitely the worst in the series, is as flat as a pancake from start to finish, with a ""mystery"" as complex as an Encyclopedia Brown story. Chee and Leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless, awkward exposition. Side characters slide in and out with no real purpose. The only cop who Hillerman seems to be interested in, the fetching Bernie Manuelito, becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy's game of drugs and power. Even Hillerman's trademark Ansel Adams-esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant. Hillerman can't even figure out how to end it properly, resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic ""epilogue"" that seems like it was written two hours before deadline.
This series really does have a lot of legs in it, but Hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving. Perhaps it's time for someone else to take over with Hillerman serving as consultant. Because it would be a shame for Chee and Leaphorn to continue on the downward spiral that has plagued Hillerman's most recent efforts."
346,346,3,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,0002005263,Tucker Andersen,"This book seems to be Tony Hillerman attempting to masquerade as James Patterson. Some familiar characters, a murder and related violence, short chapters, almost continual action and extremely limited character development. (Eliminate the many blank pages between chapters and it is barely two hundred small pages of large type. Thus, it is overpriced.)
The story has great potential. It has the well known characters of Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and Bernie Manuelito, now separated geograpically from Chee as a rookie Border Patrol officer and with the future of their relationship in doubt. When a puzzling murder in Chee's jurisdiction intersects with Bernie's work, the retired ""Legendary Lieutenant "" Joe Leaphorn is called upon for consultation. At the same time there seems to be a puzzling interest emanating from a powerful source in Washington, D.C. concerning the ramifications of the case.
There is an intimation that the dead man may have been investigating the actual scandal concerning the loss (probably due to a combination of theft, embezzlement, indifference and incompetence) of billions of dollars of royalties from the Indian Tribal Royalty Fund held in trust by the Department of the Interior. This is a topic with great potential for an author with Hillerman's skills and knowledge, but it becomes peripheral to a pretty standard police procedural combined with the mystery of how the romance between Bernie and Jim will conclude. There is some excellent misdirection regarding both the nature of the underlying crinimal activity and its participants and who or what is the real ""SINISTER PIG"". But a lot of the oppportunities to develop the potential plot complications and resultant suspense were simply never pursued. Also, there were several loose ends that were never satisfactorily tied up despite the attempt to do so in the epilogue. (I cannot go into details without revealing too much of the plot.) It is almost as if Hillerman had an outline for a wonderfully complex story and then decided it was too complicated and so decided to quickly bring this part of the story to a close and leave the rest for a sequel.
As the title of my review implies, a few elements helped me decide to generously round up my rating to three stars. First, the plot is clever, and there is sufficient misdirection to keep the reader's interest. Second, it involves familiar characters. Third, this is a incredibly fast read. It is definitely a book for a short trip or a rainy afternoon. So if you are a Hillerman fan, lower your expectations and enjoy a few hours updating yourself on the latest happenings in New Mexico."
347,347,4,A26MAEXDS5Y1HZ,0002005263,John W. Bates,"For the dedicated Hillerman reader, this latest may be disappointing.  We have become accustomed to excellent mysteries which are also anthropology lessons.  In almost if not every story of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman has presented his readers with lessons about many facets of the southwestern Native American culture, the problems this culture faces.  This novel is more a straight thriller, without significant overtones of cultural stress and adaptation.  The basic plot line does have a Native American connection.  It seems that the Department of the Interior is responsible for a trust fund for Native Americans.  The trust is where royalties and other payments for oil, gas, timber, and other sales from reservation lands are deposited so that the money can be used for the benefit of the tribes.  It also seems that tens of billions of dollars which should be in the trust are not, and there doesn't seem to be any explanation.  A senator hires a retiring CIA specialist in pipelines to investigate what is happening in the ""four-corners"" territory, especially as it related to activities of a billionaire recluse who may be dabbling in hard drugs as well as petroleum.  The implication is that the billionaire is diverting gas and oil from the pipeline and avoiding paying royalties-or anything else.  The covert investigator is found murdered on the reservation and Jim Chee is the investigating officer.  But the FBI claims jurisdiction, transfers case management to Washington, and then stonewalls.  Chee wonders why the apparent cover-up and keeps on digging.  Enough waves are made that DC people involved in investigating the trust fund situation wonder if there is a connection and ask Joe Leaphorn, now retired, to look into the case.  What follows is a very good thriller, with unlikely ""heroes"" and bad guys getting their just desserts.  The implications of Washington insider conspiracies are raised but never resolved; yet, while not quite up to Hillerman's stories which do have stronger cultural lessons, this is a very good book.  PS: the sinister pig is not Native American but pipeline related.  Read the book to find out what the title reference is about."
348,348,1,A3LNHS3SDP4AFO,0002005263,R. Altizer,"OK, I thought, ""The Wailing Wind"" was an aberration, a hiccup in the career of a very good author.  But two points define a line, and ""The Sinister Pig"" plots Mr. Hillerman's career straight down.  In the corporate world you sometimes see a luminary from an earlier era who is ""RIP"" -- retired in place -- just going through the motions, living on past glories and collecting the big bucks for his reputation, not his current work.  Sadly, this describes Tony Hillerman, who has decided to stir around a few ashes, thow in a highly predictable conclusion, and call it a novel.  I bet he's laughing at his readers all the way to the bank.
As for the book itself, reviewers occasionally describe a film as ""OK for a 10-minute sketch on SNL, but not a 90-minute feature.""  That's Sinister Pig for you: interesting premise but almost no plot or character development (call central casting for all the stereotypes), no suspense (you know from the start who's really a bad guy and who's really not), and the shallowest of literary style (like Wailing Wind, everyone is constantly ""grinning"" at everyone else).  The initial plot device, investigating diversion of Indian royalty payments, is both interesting and topical -- it's really happening -- but couldn't lead to a facile wrap-up in a mere 224 pages, so Mr. Hillerman switches to just another standard contraband tale.  Rest assured, the good guys prosper, the bad guys pay, and the bad guys who are really good guys ... well, what do you expect?
I did like the little polemics on stealing of Indian royalties, the vested interest of both narcos and narcs in keeping the ""War on Drugs"" going full steam, and the pervasiveness of corruption in high office, but they weren't enough to salvage an otherwise trivial work.
If Mr. Hillerman hasn't retired completely, I'll wait until his next book is available in the public domain before reading it."
349,349,3,AH7ZG2XVL5WOW,0002005263,Bobbrun,"The reading of this book became a real chore....I found myself reading just to be reading, but not really enjoying. The beginning of the book was confusing, boring and not very well written.  The pace did seem to pick up when there was more of Chee/Leaphorn. The last 9-10 chapters, which were good, sort of balanced out the first 17-18 which were mediocre, hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 star.  And, while I'm crabbing, I want to address the fairly recent practice of putting out 200 page books for $....  I'm beginning to read some of the lesser known authors with ""hefty"" books so that I feel that I am getting my ""money's worth""."
350,350,1,AXGBP1OF2972H,0002005263,Erin Dwyer,"I am a devoted Hillerman fan and have read (and sometimes re-read) all of his books. I anxiously awaited publication of Sinister Pig to feed my Hillerman Jones.
I don't know who wrote this book, but it wasn't Hillerman. It was poorly plotted, with  weak character definition and bad dialog.
What's a fan to do?"
351,351,1,A3NMT1447ME6PC,0002005263,David,"I agree with many other of the negative reviews, I found Sinister Pig to be a boring disappointment. The Jim Chee character has always had romance problems and I always thought they were poorly written about; however, I could speed read through and ignore those portions and still greatly enjoy the book because of its strengths, the various tribal cultural, religious and mythological connections to a crime mystery, and descriptions of the Four Corners high desert landscape. Those strong aspects were missing from this book.  If he must include romantic relationships in his books, Mr. Hillerman should join up with a successful romance novelist.  If you're a Hillerman fan, skip this book."
352,352,3,A3HCPK54FATFO4,0002005263,Mike Garrison,"This is not really a Chee/Leaphorn novel. It does not take place on the Navajo Reservation, neither Chee nor Leaphorn is really involved in the crime, and the crime really has nothing to do with Navajo culture in any way. In fact, the effort to involve them comes off as contrived.
While Bernie is more of a central character, she is a weak central character. All we find out about her is that she is sad and misses Jim Chee. We don't even get to see her as a very professional cop.
The most interesting character is actually Budge (a hatchet man for a cartoonish Very Bad Rich Guy). If only the novel had been written about him, from his viewpoint, it could have been great. As it was, it was just an OK but forgettable standard cop/mystery story.
It couldn't even decide if it was going to be a story about exploitation of Indian resources or about smuggling drugs. And while I support legalization of most drugs, the discussion of that in the book was heavyhanded and simplistic.
It really seemed as though Hillerman had a bunch of topics and series plot developments on a checklist, but was searching for a real novel to slip them into. Sadly, he came up with this threadbare framework instead.
The stylistic skill was as good as ever (thus the three stars), but you know what they say about putting lipstick on a pig...."
353,353,1,AMFB2GBB2O84X,0002005263,Brakaian,"I am a huge Tony Hillerman fan -- I've read each of his novels multiple times and have enjoyed all of them.  My favorites are Dance Hall of the Dead and Skinwalkers.
The Sinister Pig, simply put, is an awful book, and is not even close to the level Hillerman has set for himself.  Much of the action takes place on airplanes and in limousines, and next to nothing occurs anywhere close to the Navajo reservation.  Hillerman tries to introduce the flavor of the New Mexico/Mexico border region, but his descriptions do not even come close to the standard he set for the Four Corners area.  Had I not been to this area many times myself (I grew up in Arizona) I wouldn't be able to distinguish the border region from Kentucky.  Finally, the subtlety and grace of earlier Hillerman character interaction -- Leaphorn and Emma, Chee and Mary Landon, and so on -- has been blown away by a sudden urge by Hillerman to make everything explicit.  Yes, Tony, we know Chee loves Bernie and Bernie loves Chee -- why do you have to pound it in to us in every single scene?
This book was, simply put, painful to read, and I wouldn't have finished it at all were I not such a big Hillerman fan.  If you are new to Hillerman, please please please do not begin with this poor work.  And if you haven't read every Hillerman novel, probably multiple times, my advice is to put this one aside and go back to those books you haven't read, or haven't read in a while.  I really wonder, seriously, if Hillerman farmed this out to some ghost writer -- it really has the feel of some poor shmuck trying to mimic Hillerman's characters....... it's sad, because I had really hoped that Tony had one or two good novels still left in him, but if The Sinister Pig is any indication, he doesn't.  Very, very sad."
354,354,2,A3NGN97HO5BA95,0002005263,Brad Schram,"To be fair, I must state up-front that I'm not unbiased--I like most of Tony Hillerman's books a lot.  During the late sixties and early seventies I spent a part of each year visiting some of the Navajo Reservation's more remote places, meeting people and learning.  Hillerman's books typically convey the setting and its people lovingly, yet genuinely, without cloying sentimentality.
In his latest book, however, Hillerman badly misfires.  If I didn't know his primary characters from previous novels I would not care about them after reading The Sinister Pig.  Leaphorn, Chee, and the emerging Bernadette Manuelito are merely cardboard cutouts in his latest book; the author plainly depends (more than usual) on a continuing readership to carry the breadth of character forward.  Although the devoted reader can flesh out the primary characters from memory, he/she gets little help with the evil villain and his minions.  One gets only the thinnest of characterizations, explanations, and interconnections--even though a potential wealth of story lurks beneath the premise.
Delivering Leaphorn and Chee into drug-smuggling intrigue on the Mexican border strains credulity, the mechanism drawing them there barely plausible.  One wonders if Hillerman may have simply dashed this book onto paper in order to bridge an interlude instructing the faithful as to the continuing nature of the Chee-Manuelito relationship. It is as if Hillerman had neglected fulfilling a contract to write a book a year for Harper-Collins until the last month--tossing this off to meet a deadline.
Thinness of plot extends to thinness of the book generally--it would barely make 200 pages if the publisher had not left the last page of many chapters blank, while including them in the page count.
One dearly hopes that Mr. Hillerman returns to the reservation, becoming so engrossed in his next story that the smell of cedar smoke is not lost amidst corporate jets and big-city chaos."
355,355,3,A2W4B5871IRPUD,0002005263,J. Carmichael,"It almost seems as if Hillerman is trying rush the Leaphorn/Chee serial to a happy ending for his readers so he can quit writing them.  In true Hillerman form, the plot had great potential rooted in current events, but came up shallow.  For me it was reminiscent of some of Hillerman's work in the 80s when he seemed obsessed with the professional killer who was in turn obsessed with his parents (which isn't necessarily bad, it worked very well in ""People of Darkness"").  There are some twists and surprises, but not enough to save it.  Even a bad Hillerman Leaphorn/Chee story is a good read for me, but I was spoiled by ""Sacred Clowns"" and ""Hunting Badger""!!"
356,356,5,A3AD071UEP20WS,0002005263,Roger Long,"There is something immensely satisfying, comfortable, and compelling about a Tony Hillerman mystery.  None of those is quite the right word, but they will have to do.  Other readers have reviewed the plot, so I'll skip that.  Perhaps the characters are what are so electric.  One just has to like Jim Chee, the patient Navajo policeman, and his lieutenant emeritus, Joe Leaphorn.  By now they are old friends to Hillerman's many readers.  In the book just previous to this, we are introduced to Janet Pete's replacement--Ms. Pete went off to the city and left Jim Chee brokenhearted.  Chee's new love interest (most obliquely) reprises here and is even more charming than last time.
Still, it may not be the characters that drive a Hillerman mystery.  Perhaps it is the very land itself, the Four Corners high desert of New Mexico, the Navajo people, their culture, the sacred mountains, the dusty, rutted roads, the hogans, the ceremonies and shamans and fears and prejudices.
All I know is that I eagerly await Hillerman's novels, and I'm a bit sorry I read this one already, since the wait for the next one will be even longer."
357,357,2,A1F76LOFW5JJC2,0002005263,UnkWot,"I have enjoyed most of Hillerman's novels for many years but ""The Sinister Pig"" I found to be a shallow novel written without heart or depth.  It almost seems the author let his computer write the book.  Possibly he is tired of these characters and needs a new format.  I read the entire book hoping the author's wonderful writing style would be found, but alas it was not to be."
358,358,4,A2NH86IELLJSE4,0002005263,JEFF LEE,"After reading Sinister Pig, you might think the plot too improbable, however, I enjoyed the change of direction.  At least once in awhile.  The setting still takes place in the deserts of the Southwest, however Navajo lore is not the focus.  A new villian appears in the form of a Washington, D.C. powerbroker.  The villian is somewhat simplistic but one of his henchmen is not and that makes up for it.  It was a very fast read and I found myself satisfied at the end.  Hillerman is Hillerman!  And he is still damn good at what he does."
359,359,5,A7E2MSRVHAAO1,0002005263,Plastic Larry,"Great book and lots of fun but absolutely no Indian or Southwest anthropology or cultural flavor. It could have taken place in Manhatten or Miami or anywhere and the characters could be anyone. The legendary Leaphorn plays Nero Wolf or Spencer and Che is his  legman or HAWK. This is the happiest of all his stories but is the only one that you do not learn anything except the meanings of ""Sinister Pig"".All the new and old loose ends with some surprises, but you close the book happy. For the first time in a dozen books, you don't find yourself hoarse yelling at CHE to say the right thing."
360,360,1,A1HD50VEPZYO0O,0002005263,Michael,"I am a big Hillerman fan but found this book sadly lacking in the normal quality that I would expect from Mr. Hillerman. The story line as noted in other reviews was weak and thin to say the least. Character development was left at the sketch level, and the plot was not supported by the narrative.
Several examples of this include the plot line between Chee and Officer Bernadette Manuelito. It was simplified to the point where all we read about was his yearning for her, and her for him. The level of which was dime store at best. Secondly, in trying to tie all the lead character's in, we find ourselves jumping from one simple story line connection to another. Chee to Leaphorn to Bernadette Manuelito, to an unknown power broker in Washington, etc. The resolution of the story lines would have better off in a typical weekly tv show. Since when did we see in a Hillerman book, the paid killer letting his feelings get the better of him and saving both Bernadette Manuelito and the Senator's girlfriend.
If someone wanted to read Hillerman I would send them back to any of the previous books and tell them to stay away from this one."
361,361,4,A2EJ7CM6ANG7DT,0002005263,foltz85,"I love Tony Hillerman.  In my mind, he cannot write a bad novel.  Also he seems to be a very genuine individual.  The characters he creates are unique in mystery fiction.  I would love just reading about them going to the mall.
This is most conventional Hillerman yet, and I don't mind.  It starts with a mysterious man who gets killed in the first chapter (in Hillerman novels, the murder always happens in the first chapter).  It then brings Jim Chee in, them switches to Bernie Manuelito far from home and eventually in enters Joe Leaphorn with his professor friend.  And eventually even Cowboy Dashee (?) enteres the story.  Its like a gathering of old friends.  It even has a sympathic hitman.
I agree with most all of the criticism of this book and I don't care.  A few years ago, Mr. Hillerman had a case of cancer and didn't write anything for a while.  I guess I count every book after that a bonus book.
As you can tell, this is not an objective review.  I'll take a book like this from Hillerman over about every other author I read which includes Jonathan Kellerman, Ruth Rendell and Colin Dexter.  I like Alex Delaware, Inspector Wexford and Chief Inspector Morse, but the Navajo people as portrayed by Mr. Hillerman are uniquely interesting."
362,362,4,A2F6N60Z96CAJI,0002005263,Bookreporter,"It's not on the agenda for this year, or even next year, but while I still have all of my wits about me, I want to sit down and read all of Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee novels in chronological order. Hillerman has masterfully evolved both of these characters over the past couple of decades, introducing Leaphorn, then Chee, and having them meet at respectful loggerheads and gradually develop a mutual admiration as their respective worlds evolve and change. Hillerman has done this so well that one would think he had everything planned out before he even set the first word to paper lo those many years ago, though that seems impossible. No matter. Hillerman remains unrivaled in his ability to capture the people and culture --- and the nuances of both --- of the American Southwest.
THE SINISTER PIG, Hillerman's latest novel, finds Leaphorn adjusting to retirement and life as a widower, while Jim Chee investigates the mysterious death of a stranger on the edge of the Jicarella Apache natural gas field. Though the Navajo Tribal Police have jurisdiction, the FBI quickly moves in and classifies the incident as a hunting accident. Chee, however, is not satisfied. The victim was not dressed for hunting and was stripped of identification. The proximity of his body to the natural gas field indicates that he might have been investigating charges that billions of dollars from the sale of gas have been embezzled from the Indian Tribal royalty trust. But if that was the case, for whom was he conducting the investigation?
The stakes become personal for Chee as he finds that photographs taken by Bernie Manuelito may have some bearing on the matter. Manuelito, a former member of Chee's squad and now with the Border Patrol, took the photos in the course of her investigation of suspicious activity around a ranch in southern New Mexico. She is unaware, however, that her photographs tie in with Chee's case and put her in terrible danger from an unexpected source. Chee must rely on his own knowledge, as well as Leaphorn's wise counsel and connections, if he is to resolve the mystery of the dead stranger and save Manuelito's life.
THE SINISTER PIG contains all of the elements that Hillerman is known for --- the interplay between Leaphorn and Chee, the strong characterization, and the intimate knowledge of Indian tribal culture and relationships. Chee is a particularly subtle delight here, as he struggles to come to grips with his feelings for Manuelito and his almost painful inability to articulate them.
The most significant aspect of THE SINISTER PIG, however, is the villain of the piece who gives this novel its name. A sinister pig is one who has more than he or she can use, but still wants more. The shadowy Rawley Winsor, in this case, is the sinister pig, and he is one of the more interesting adversaries you'll encounter in literature this year. And his assistant, the enigmatic Budge, practically makes the book all by himself. One almost gets the feeling that THE SINISTER PIG could easily have been twice the length of its 224 pages, that the story wants to burst out of its binding with more that could be told. Regardless, THE SINISTER PIG remains a worthy addition to Hillerman's canon.

363,363,1,A34Y8CPXE6AFI0,0002005263,tom,The plot in this was so far fetched and unrealistic as to be appalling. No where near his usual standards. To understand the characters you have to have read other books in the seris. This is not a stand alone book. Mr. Hillerman must have needed the money to write and publish a novel so inept.
364,364,5,A9ETDX5K04DY,0002005263,Billy J. Hobbs,"In ""The Sinister Pig,"" Tony Hillerman tackles more universal concerns.  His Navajo Reservation gang is up to its elbows in trying to solve yet another homicide.  This time, it's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions, not the least to the very center of America itself, Washington D.C.
Hillerman's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation.  The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade, massive fraud by oil and gas organizations, and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border.  Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they're reading from a daily newspaper (lately described as ""America's newest fiction form!"") editorial page.  Still, the issues he present couldn't be more relevant.
Granted, he takes care of his established characters. The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles: his relationship with Bernie, his responsibility to his native culture, and his loyalty to his job.  Hillerman has no problem with any of this, yet ""The Sinister Pig"" seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author.  This book seems to concentrate on action rather than devote much time to personal philosophy and Navajo culture.  Nonetheless, Hillerman has another winner."

His books featuring Leaphorn and Chee, for me, are the best of the lot, so Sinister Pig goes right to the top of the list.
Here's the thing: Hillerman and his editors KNOW anything he writes is going to sell like thermal longjohns in Alaska. But still, his books read like they've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit.
Sinister Pig deals with murder - of course - dum-de-dum-dum: otherwise, it wouldn't be a Hillerman mystery. It also deals with lots and lots of $$$ missing from the Tribal Trust, drugs, greed, and hanky-panky on the 'rez.' I just wish Janet Whatzername, Chee's first love interest, hadn't vanished from the series so early... Here comes Bernadette Manuelito, however, to take up the slack.
Don't miss it - but here's the thing lots of casual readers don't realize: You can take a Hillerman book, a topographical map of the Four Corners area, and a 4-wheel drive vehicle, and actually track down every single rock and arroyo and mesa and creek that's mentioned. Trust me: I've done it."

When I buy a Hillerman book, I don't want to read about an evil, faceless puppetmaster who pulls string in Washington and wrecks havoc in the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn's 'four corners' of the world.
I want to read about problems on the reservation...or difficulties within the Navajo Tribal Police...or about how the native Americans are trying to preserve their ancient knowledge.....or about how Joe Leaphorn is finding a new life after the death of his beloved wife...or about how Jim Chee can't ever get it right with women.  I also want the book to be more than 240 pages.  This story felt like formula fiction, something Hillerman has avoided up to now.
The story about siphoned off oil and gas probably needs to be told, but I think a non-fiction expose would be a better venue for unveiling what could possibly be the biggest heist in history.
I had another issue with the story.  I never for one minute believed the author's reasoning behind Bernadette Mauelito's leaving the Navajo Tribal Police for a job with the Board Patrol.  Bernie was too close to her family/clan to move to the Mexican border.  It was completely out of character for her.  I would have understood a 'temporary assignment' with the feds, but having her choose to make that kind of radical move just never felt right.
For Jim Chee fans, the book does contain a pleasant surprise.  I look forward to seeing how Chee handles it in the next story.
This is not Hillerman's best -- but after so many good ones, he's due a hiccup."
367,367,5,A2UL2HW5BFQ4QC,0002005263,Betty Meador,"I can't remember ever having as much pleasure as I had from reading the conclusion of this story last evening. Yes, it isn't lengthy, but I found it exceptionally enjoyable."
368,368,5,A3SFETHRODPP8W,0002005263,watzizname,"This latest Hillerman mysery features all the usual (by now) characters, Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, Louisa Bourbonette, Bernie Manuelito, Cowboy Dashee, and a new hero, whose name I won't mention, because to do so might spoil some of the surprise, but I hope we will be seeing more of that person.

The action takes place in southwestern New Mexico, the location of Bernie's new job, and therein lies the missed opportunity.  If only Tony Hillerman had gotten together with Judith A. Jance and brought Joanna Brady in to help, there might have been two novels about the same events, this one and another by Jance, from Joanna Brady's viewpoint.  I, for one, would have loved to read both, and I am sure I am not alone.

Nonetheless, ""The Sinister Pig"" is a very enjoyable read, for which thank you, Tony Hillerman!  Let us hope for many more to come!

369,369,4,AVYHIKHA6KRJF,0002005263,marzipan,"I've fallen in love with Joe Leaphorn and Jim  Chee in all the other books involving one or both of these Navajo Tribal policemen.  It's usually so satisfying to see the way the Legendary Lieutenant approaches a problem, especially in contrast to his younger  colleague.  So I've always must see what they're up to, and so should  most readers who consider the mystery capable of plenty of literary satisfaction.  As always,  Hillerman's  descriptions of the Navajo Nation  landscape are wonderful; so real you can almost  feel the charged air as summer thunderstorms  build, hear  water racing down the wash,  see and touch the earth.
Unfortunately, this latest  book strays too far from home.  Hillerman doesn't capture the beauty of the more southern desert and  Apache country. While Bernie Manuelito is usually somewhat endearing,  in  this book her behavior is almost too wide-eyed to be plausible, especially considering she's a cop.  And Chee and Leaphorn, as  well as  the ever-appealing Cowboy Dashee, seem  like minor characters in what turns out to be a fairly stock spy/thriller caper, with a bad guy so bad he's  almost comic.  And the ending--please Mr.  Hillerman--you've  got to keep Jim  Chee forever  lost and questing!  If he grows up,  the world will grow old..."
370,370,4,A3TGNIQ0R3V6L7,0002005263,dikybabe,"It is always wonderful to open another Hillerman and follow the latest law enforcement adventure in the Four Corners.  Meeting up with Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn is just like meeting up with old friends.  And reading this newest Hillerman brings one quite up-to-date with each of the men, their current love life, and their efforts to solve a mystery of international intrigue.
This is not Hillerman's best novel, but one can forgive him because he does present a fast page turner and educates along the way.  Chee's romantic interest, Bernie Manuelito has gone to work for the Feds in the Border Patrol, and unlikely as it may seem, she becomes linked to a murder in the Four Corners.
The pig involved takes on several meanings, but would be especially familiar to anyone in the pipeline trade.  The double meaning, of course, indicates the greed that leads to corruption within governmental bodies.
This tale involves Washington, D. C. subterfuge, and enlists the Navajo Tribal Police,  U. S. Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Border Patrol,  the F. B. I., and the Office of Homeland Security.  Hillerman skillfully sets his tale in the midst of the real world worries of the 21st century.
Will ""third time's charm"" work for Chee in his stumbling romance with Bernadette?  The romance and the mystery intertwine for a comfortable quick read and satisfying solution.
Can't wait for the next Hillerman in order to meet up Leaphorn and Chee once more.  If you are a Hillerman fan, this is a must read."
371,371,4,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,0002005263,Donald Mitchell,"The Sinister Pig is one of Tony Hillerman's deftest plots and best designed stories.  Be careful not to read reviews that tell too much of the plot, or much of the book's pleasure will be needlessly spoiled for you.  Some will not like this story as much as previous ones because it moves into new ground, both geographically and story-telling-wise.  Having that reaction is like failing to appreciate the latest model of Ferrari while being totally fixated on the 1950s versions.  Be open to the evolution of Mr. Hillerman's skill and the potential of his characters.
Because this book relies so much on past character development to establish its story, it would be a major mistake to make this the first book you read in the series.  If you start with this book, the big mystery will be finding out who all of the people are and why the story involves them.  I think this is one of those series where you really should start at the beginning and work on from there.
This story is told from the perspective of several different characters, none of whom know everything that is going on.  As the reader, you are privy to more of their thoughts and knowledge than any of them have which helps you anticipate what will happen next.  Yet, until near the end, the ultimate meanings of the book's title will be hidden from you.  It's a nice job of misdirection and a gradual, tasty unpeeling of the story grape.
Neither Jim Chee nor Joe Leaphorn are the center of this story, although they play major roles.  This is Bernie Manuelito's story although she doesn't appear in the book's opening.  She has left some of her frustrations with Jim Chee and the Navajo Tribal Police to join the U.S. Customs Border Patrol near the border of Arizona and New Mexico.  This takes her 200 miles from the reservation, and she's lonely despite making friends there.  She alternates pining for Jim and being annoyed by his seeming aloofness in letters.  He misses her desperately, but cannot bring himself to do anything about it.  Bernie finds her new job emotionally and physically challenging because it involves both stopping illegal immigrants who may be in trouble after being abandoned by the coyote guides who lead them and dangerous drug smugglers who will stop at nothing to get their valuable, illegal cargoes through.
In the background to the story are a mysterious investigation of misappropriation of billions in royalties due to Tribal Trust Funds from oil and gas sales, an unexplained death which the FBI hushes up, a Washington power broker who desperately wants the war on drugs to continue, former CIA agents and operatives, blackmail, a missing mistress, an exotic game ranch, an investigative reporter, and unexplained construction in the middle of nowhere.
The book's only flaw is that the villain is portrayed in terms that are a little too extreme to be credible.  He's more like a James Bond foe than a Tony Hillerman criminal.
The overall theme of this book is about how our misperceptions of what is going on are likely to lead us astray.  These misperceptions may be based on differences in language and culture, knowing only parts of the facts, having facts be withheld from us, or by assuming what others tell us is true when it is not.  Mr. Hillerman does a masterful job of portraying all of these problems, and showing that it is important that we act on our desire to know more . . . rather than being satisfied with what appears to be going on at the surface.  Better solutions are at hand, if only we grasp them.
After you finish this fine book, I suggest that you think about where you may be misperceiving the potential around you.  How can you test the accuracy and completeness of those perceptions where it's important?

372,372,4,A359U0JFFZ0Q04,0002005263,Dave Schwinghammer,"I hadn't been expecting to hear from Tony Hillerman again so soon. It hasn't been that long since THE WAILING WIND.
 This one is a very rapid read, with much of the action happening away from the Navajo reservation (Always a bad move, Tony). The plot centers around the murder of a retired CIA operative who's investigating the theft of billions of dollars in Indian oil, gas, coal, and timber royalties for a United States senator.
 Bernie Manuelito has taken a job with the border patrol to get away from Jim Chee, her pushy boss, when she stumbles across a suspicious construction project in the middle of the desert. Unknowingly, she has become embroiled in a smuggling operation and her picture is being spread around by Mexican drug traffickers as a DEA agent to be on the lookout for. Meanwhile, Chee is pining away for Bernie, trying to think of a reason to go get her and ask her to marry him. This is where Joe Leaphorn enters the picture. He gets out his maps and is able to tie the original murder scene to some abandoned oil and gas pipelines leading from Sonora, Mexico, to the site of the murder. The Sinister Pig of the title is a device used to clean the insides of the pipelines. Joe quickly grasps the possibilities.
 Hillerman uses multiple viewpoints to help us follow the action. There's a billionaire drug smuggler, his former CIA pilot (the most interesting character in the book), and a corrupt border patrol supervisor and of course our friends Joe, Jim, and Bernie.
 I'd be surprised if this book is over 70,000 words it reads so fast. I liked a couple of things about it, besides Chee and Leaphorn of course, two of the best characters in the mystery genre: the factual basis of the book, the royalty money which the Department of the Interior lost or stole and the great character, Budge C. de Baca, the billionaire's pilot, a romantic felon I haven't seen anywhere else. I also like Cowboy Dashee, a recurring character in the Leaphorn/Chee series, who is now working for the Bureau of Land Management. He and Chee add comic relief to what might otherwise be a pretty conventional mystery."

Why is the story about candy toys and presents  and then how does Humpty Dumpty end up in the story !?  This book definitely flies off the rails by the end.

459,459,3,A18LCUFMH0EUWJ,0001384198,Big Russ,"It is a quality book, very large, great for a grand child to read to. I knocked off two stars for one reason. Due to the NEW distributor needing to show how wonderful they are, the distributor changed the sex of the little engine that could to female. So now, all reference to the engine are now ""she"", instead of what the original author Watty Piper intended. I am really getting mad at people rewriting history and white washing it like this book has done. All the engines were male in the original, and they should be all male in this new printing. Looking for an original now."

The pictures are so good that even the younger non-readers can look at a page and know how to tell what is happening, and ""read themselves a story."" The cardboard is strong enough to resist the little hands, but not clumsy. We have made a game of chanting the refrain quicker and quicker, until success,  and sometimes, I even hear them applying it to when going gets rough...."

470,470,5,A1O8C1KIFXBCUF,0001384198,missy,Such a great book! Classic and must have for your little one's collection. My son especially loves trains so this is definitely one of his favorites. My son tends to get frustrated easily and wants to give up without trying a few times often and my husband and I always love how this book teaches kids to keep trying and believe in themselves. We always loved it as a kid and now our little ones get to enjoy it as well. Highly recommend.

482,482,1,A3TYEFOT6TVW1F,0001384198,mzimm,"Horrible retelling, this one is going in the yard sale pile.  Why are the ""good"" engines girls and the ""bad"" engines boys?  Why are all these lovely toys and good things being taken over the hill to be given only to the ""good"" little boys and girls over the mountain?  Hate it.  Hate the clown, too.  Doesn't the author know how frightening clowns are for many, many children (and some adults, too)?
I miss the old original version and will be looking for it."

 In this generation, children of all ages need to be inspired and determined to be successful. They need to be told that anything is possible as long as they work hard for what they want. Without this encouragement, children lose sight of what they can accomplish, and every parent wants their child to be as successful as possible. The book, The Little Engine That Could by Watty Piper does just this for any child that reads this story. Even though the targeted audience of this book was ages four to eight, the older the reader is, the better the message is understood. This book should be read by every child during their childhood.
 The book, The Little Engine That Could, by Watty Piper is a forty-eight page inspiration to all children, and has been since 1930, the original books copyright year. Both, boys and girls become very engaged in this book through the colors, pictures, and incredibly positive tone. Not only does the book have great illustrations for the children to look at, but the story line for the book gives off a favorable message. In the beginning of the book, there is a train that is carrying dolls, a funny clown, toys for everyone, and good food. The train needs to get over the mountain to the town before the children wake up. The suspenseful conflict is that the train stops working and cannot get over the mountain. The train, and all the toys in the train, start to panic, so they ask for help from passing trains. The first two trains did not stop to help so the toys became upset, but then another little, blue engine came. Although the blue engine was small and never went up the mountain, he still stopped to try and help. The little engine pulled the train, meanwhile stating, I think I can, I think I can. With this positive mentality, the little blue engine successfully pulled the train with all the toys for the kids over the mountain.
The powerful theme of this book is to always stay positive and always try your best.  Who knows, you might surprise yourself, like the little blue engine did. This is a message that not only children need to hear but everyone can hear from time-to-time. The little blue engine believed in itself and did as good as he could, and to his surprise he made it up and over the mountain, even though he had never gone over the mountain before. This I can attitude is beneficial for everyone.
 Me being almost twenty years old, I still think about this childrens picture book. I played varsity softball all four years of high school. Before the first game of each of the four years my coach read the team this book and then we set our goals for the season. I think this was very beneficial for us because it helped us realize how much is possible to achieve. During those four years, we set several school, county, and state records, as well as, made it to the state championship my sophomore year and won the state championship my senior year. I personally think that the team reading this book had a huge part in our success. There have also been spin-offs of this book. It has been rewritten several times, and the theme has been transformed into a poem. I keep this poem with me everywhere I go, and have it memorized. A section of it was even my senior quote. This poem reads,
If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you dont.
If you like to win but think you cant,
Its almost certain you wont.

If you think youll lose, you're lost,
For out in the world we find,
Success begins with a fellows will,
Its all in the state of mind.

If you think you're outclassed, you are.
Youve got to think high to rise.
Youve got to be sure of yourself,
Before you can ever win a prize.

Lifes battles don't always go,
To the stronger or faster man.
But sooner or later, the man who wins,
Is the man who thinks he can!

The theme of this book is not the only feature that gets the childrens attention. There are also several other factors. Because this is a picture book targeting four to eight year olds, there is an illustration of each page and only two to four lines of words on each page. The font size of the words are large so that its simpler for the children to read. The pictures are very colorful which help attract the readers attention. Another tool used to grab the attention of the readers is bringing some of the characters alive. This is also known as personification. An example of personification in the story is the toys stating that they want to help. So, The clown and the animals climbed out of their cars. They tried to push the little train. This gives the toys human-like features because they are speaking and climbing out of the cars. Another device used in this childrens book is onomatopoeia. This is used when the author, Watty Piper, wanted to describe the sound the trains were making. An example of this is the first line of the book, when it says, Chug, chug, chug. Puff, puff, puff. This helps the children create better imagery of what is happening, which will keep the children engaged in the book.
These are all important pieces of the book that came together to make a childrens book that has been flourishing for over eighty-five years. Like I said before, this book is a must-read for all children. Because of its positivity and suspenseful story-line, it is good for children of all ages, not just four to eight years old. I highly recommend this childrens picture book."

This story is about some toys whose train broke down and ask other trains to help them, but most other trains do not because they don't pull lowly toys.  This story sucks."

This one is a 1954 revised edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. The revised illustrations have a 50s look and more vibrant colors. Watty Piper is the author of the story for both editions, which story appears in print around the beginning of the twentieth century."

527,527,3,A30P53PUPJZBO0,0001384198,Polka Dot,"The reason that I gave this book three stars is that they have changed the engine to ""a girl"".  I recognize the value in that change for little girls and think it's perfect to teach girls that they can do what they want to do. However, I have a little boy. I have observed that we seemed to have moved from one extreme to another.  I want my little boy to know he too can reach for the stars."

It's a board book and the story is short enough (and fun enough) to keep a little ones attention all the way through.  It was my son's favorite book when he was little and I was thrilled to find this for my nephew! Over 15 years later, and I still know almost all the words!"

533,533,1,A3N403N5XT9K5J,0001384198,Amazon Customer,"I ordered several books that were christmas gifts from my mother to her grandchildren,great grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren.  She is in a nursing home and requested specific books for specific children, which were indicated on the gift tags for each book.  We also selected to have them gift wrapped.  On Christmas morning, all the children selected their presents and opened them, only to find out that the tags were ALL wrong!  there was not one that was correct, so the end result of a meaningful heart felt gift turned into a joke!  If you are not able to perform these requests correctly I suggest you not offer them at all.  At least the all did get delivered to the correct address.  Very disappointing.  I am not even going to tell my mother."

543,543,2,ALHF6CIZIPAYO,0001384198,Tim,It was ok. I had the original board book one and my son loved it. I had to replace it from all the wear of it being used. This one just seems like they cut out all the good stuff. Doesn't really feel like a story as much anymore. I hate saying that because I know there's always out there complaining when they revamp or edit a story. This time I think the editing cut down to much of the stories main theme.

I don't want a refund, my husband just found a tiny miniature Thomas the Train that our grandson can drive along the tracks by hand instead. I'm just disappointed."

Great introduction for Growth Mindsets."

571,571,3,AG1HV4EGGE3UJ,0001384198,Jamie,"Great story, but why, why did they have to make the hero train a girl??  Leave the original as it is!"
572,572,1,A1DFQY8N5H8FKR,0001384198,Amazon Customer,I didn't realize it didn't come with train. That should have been made more clear to notice before ordering
573,573,5,AZ21FFFOB56HM,0001384198,LoveTheSimple,"A favorite, classic book."
574,574,5,A3PCWMQQ3PILNS,0001384198,Esther Torrefiel,"A cute story, cute illustrations, and a nice moral.  Never Give Up!"
575,575,1,A3SCD8LGVBPTDW,0001384198,C. H.,"I should have taken my time while throwing books into my cart because this is definitely not the book I was looking for.  To begin, this thing is TINY.  I have 3 young kids and typically have to sit a ways back for them to all be able to see the pictures but this book is so small I'll need to be right in their faces.  I can see this getting problematic quickly.  I also envision it getting torn up quickly since the pages are so tiny.  I also didn't realize that this is an abridged version and does not include the entire story.  We will be returning this to purchase the hardcover version which is complete."
576,576,5,A16JWC81BOHZFJ,0001384198,Amazon Customer,"My sister bought The Little Engine That Could from here as a board book and he absolutely loves it. I love that the book is less likely to get destroyed, and he loves being able to ""read"" it by himself.  We read this book so much that my husband and I can almost recite it by heart."
577,577,3,A3BNS2R6QF43IP,0001384198,Anje Woodruffe,A lot smaller than i thought it would be. I don't advise for kids under 2. My son can tear these pages up in a heartbeat.
578,578,5,A43NE3PLNCA1Q,0001384198,D. Young,This was one of my childhood favorites.  I love the illustrations and the story.
579,579,1,AS4UBAKUQ57ZQ,0001384198,Amazon Customer,he book was not full sized edition and was an abridged version.
580,580,5,A1EQDPC1H615H2,0001384198,Mom of 2,My kids love this book. It's a great message and a classic
581,581,5,A2FUAY203GSOQ1,0001384198,Private,Satisfied
582,582,1,A2VPDU7O75JHTZ,0001384198,Desira,"Sadly not what I remembered as a child.  It is as simplistic and corny and without depth as it's time, I guess."
583,583,5,A2930OPKP2JKAW,0001384198,Amazon Customer,TOO CUTE!
584,584,5,A1FHCRVWLXK074,0001384198,Rachel,This is another book I read to my son everyday when he was young.

586,586,5,A3C4611EMOYOTE,0001384198,tlackofi,This is a classic! It's a colorful book with fun pictures that my four year old enjoyed looking at.
587,587,5,A3VOJ0XHM9UE63,0001384198,Sheryl Lynn Ellis,I purchased this for a baby shower everybody was in awe the book brought back lots of good memories.
588,588,3,ALUGXJE8QRTT8,0001384198,As Told By Tina,"We recently joined Dolly Partons Imagination Library and received The Little Engine That Could for our first book. Naima was excited to read about a choo choo train as she said. We enjoyed the illustrations and the idea that even the little engine could be helpful and accomplish a hard task.

What I didn't like about the book was that only good girls and boys were getting good food and toys. I felt like sent the wrong message to little kids. Even kids who are considered bad should get good food too.

The kids however really enjoyed this one and Im looking forward to seeing what else the Dolly Partons Imagination Library sends us."
589,589,5,AS464FLDIGCL1,0001384198,Amazon Customer,"My 40 year old son loved this story, so I purchased it for his 3 year old.  When it arrived I was concerned it may be a little 'old fashioned' for today's children; but NO.  He just loves it and we read it repeatedly.  The message in the story can never be out-dated!  This edition is beautiful.

592,592,5,A2064QWY14C22W,0001384198,William A. Love,Bought this for a baby gift.  A classic book about not giving up.  One of my kids favorites.

596,596,5,A1NKQ3W4D5ICJI,0001384198,Michael A,Given as a baby shower gift. This book is a classic. Great item.
597,597,3,A16WHBFW0NA0SQ,0001384198,David Goodman,I remember this book so differently. The pictures are great but the story is a bit tiring to read again and again
598,598,2,A1RJ6MVVDR50AG,0001384198,Sarah E Cavallari,This book is very small in size.  The font is very small as well.
599,599,5,A2QTPR51Y8LX8L,0001384198,Nikki,"Bought as a replacement for my son, who had read his first copy so many times it is in tatters...."

601,601,5,A1KWXY780J0E1,0001384198,paula,How could any parent (or grandparent) not read this to a child?!  One of my favorite memories---and my 35 year old son says the same thing!
602,602,5,A2LBSJOPX6XULR,0001384198,John Smolinski,"I begged my mother to read this book to me over and over. And because she loved me she did. Still, some 60+ years later, I look to this book for comfort and inspiration."

604,604,5,A23IKB7TWGB3ZY,0001384198,Amazon Customer,Timeless reminder that we can push through to overcome obstacles. Great for all ages!

606,606,5,A33ZA8XJAXFE03,0001384198,Amazon Shopper,This is a classic... As a little girl I would read my dad's copy from when he was a child. It really doesn't get old. I gave this as a gift to my godson and hope that he loves it as much as I do.
607,607,1,A3MK0T7QIPAGAC,0001384198,"Sir Kristoffer, Baron of Brown County","What ought to be a simple story about a train engine has been turned into a long, convoluted story mostly about a clown. Sad to see a classic story ruined so thoroughly."
608,608,5,A3W1M8QOWW9NZD,0001384198,Laureen,Perfect little gift.  This little boy's father loved this story.  I was happy to get this hardcover copy.  I know they will enjoy it.
609,609,5,A3GA0HH4J2DFYT,0001384198,Napangel,"Bought as a gift for a two year old as my son, now in his 30's, loved this book when he was a toddler.  This is a classic and a great choice for any toddler."
610,610,5,A1A8QCBNQZ997Z,0001384198,Amazon Customer,It came as advertised. the complete version.
611,611,5,A28LN0ESUIK7Q0,0001384198,petitemousie,"This is my son's favourite book!  He has gone through two copies of this book (he sleeps with it in his bed).  He had the ""normal"" sized version before, but this mini version seems to be holding up much better!  A little hard for me to read the type without my glasses on, but I pretty much have it memorized by this point. ;)  Such a classic book.  I love it!"
612,612,3,A1KEF65YX5L7Z6,0001384198,cinsalado,"Book is OK, but NO WAY it's the ""complete, original edition"" as claimed on the front cover. I have a version that I grew up reading/listening to that was published in the 50's or earlier - but no date/ISBN to verify. This book is so old that it includes two records so it can be listened to as well as read. Those of you who are old enough might remember ""Nipper"" the RCA puppy. He barks when it's time to turn the page! What great memories!  Oh, and one last thing ... My version is much, much more detailed mentioning places called 'Hither & Yon"" and NO fruits or veggies are mentioned - only toys, toys, toys!!"
613,613,5,A3GRU6DYI1O9K0,0001384198,Charity,My favorite all time book. I was given this book when I was 2 years old and ever since I have loved the story and the positive message. Always try your best and never give up. IF you think you can do something you can.

616,616,1,A1DFN58B6ABOAQ,0001384198,Amazon Customer,there was no train with the book. THe book is no good without the train. It was advertised with the train. I tried 3 different times to re-order and each time it came without the train.
617,617,5,AGCFR154O9GXY,0001384198,DancinCheri,Just like I remembered it as a little girl
618,618,5,A26XXLQ8R8TM9O,0001384198,Andrea,"This a great book.  Thanks to many reviewers for your comments. I carefully chose the hardcover original which did not disappoint. The Little Engine That Could (Original Classic Edition) Hardcover  July 31, 2001 by Watty Piper (Author), George Hauman (Illustrator), Doris Hauman (Illustrator).  It's a lovely story and it does have the ""I think I can, I think I can, I think I can....."".  I would highly recommend this book in hardcover."
619,619,5,A3VAN0CG20GXQN,0001384198,PMAC,I remember this book from 45 years ago but it was a different author? Same title and story-line.
620,620,5,A1RIFW3SHERI2T,0001384198,prm,A children's classic!
621,621,5,A3EXV92GQQI655,0001384198,jaabqn79,Love this book.  Remember it as a kid.  Read it to the grandchildren.
622,622,5,A1J3ZXZSXTL3V3,0001384198,R,A family favorite.  I prefer this original and classic book.
623,623,1,A1BCSRNGYMHXEU,0001384198,Rebecca Kneipp,WAY smaller than expected and it's cheaply made... I wouldn't purchase again. My baby is going to tear it to shreds.
624,624,5,AUHTJFFW95K9H,0001384198,KB,"A quality version of a classic children's book. I loved it as a kid, read it to my own children, and bought this one to read to my grandchildren."

626,626,3,AS8PTEMMPGRTO,0001384198,M. Champ,"I remembered this book as a classic, and my son loves trains, so I got it for him. The pictures are a bit old style, but the book is high quality construction. My main complaint is that this book is not fun to read, and since my son loves trains, I have had to read it many times. I would recommend getting the Thomas the train books instead."
627,627,5,A2LCXNQW5CUME8,0001384198,Chad,Exactly what I remember from when I was a kid.
628,628,3,A19KWF5ZJPJ6P2,0001384198,Anne E. Shupek,Mini book.  I must have misread description...I thought it was a full sized book when I ordered.
629,629,3,A1L0ZENJXX9RWO,0001384198,Laura York,"While the word spacing is an improvement from Watty Piper's original, I dislike the pictures in this version. Much prefer the old ones I grew up with."
630,630,5,A3NR5NEBF5VH5T,0001384198,Professional,A Classic!..
631,631,4,A3NVDK1O3N7GU4,0001384198,Nikki,"A little outdated in terms of the appropriateness of children's toys. My toddler is confused as to why jack knives are included in the listed gifts for the children on the other side of the mountain. Also, some of the vocabulary is sophisticated for a toddler, but mine enjoys the repetition, illustrations & story as a whole. Humpy-Dumpty makes a cameo, creating much toddler-appeal."
632,632,5,A1PWY4VZ7JDZNW,0001384198,Marcia Knight,This book belongs in the heart of every child.  It will continue to be a guide their whole life.
633,633,5,A3DFBPTZF3J4T8,0001384198,Howard G,The greatest ski book ever written.
634,634,4,AUQE4E5G777NF,0001384198,Andrea,My son loves the book. I was just disappointed that it's about the size of a cell phone. So small it's hard to read.
635,635,3,A3LYNBJ8IZBDVW,0001384198,TE,"Classic book-- just didn't realize I was buying a tiny version of it. My fault for not checking the dimensions, but it seems it could have been more clearly marked..."

637,637,5,A1344VGZID0ZZU,0001384198,Arlene J Hourdajian,Classic and I enjoyed giving it as gifts.
638,638,5,A1CZAASAJVANTN,0001384198,SC,"My 3-year-old son loves trains and had a train-themed birthday.  This was a great gift for him.  The book gets a little repetitive in the middle, but that's good for toddlers (just tiring for their adults)."
639,639,5,A2U8AFWXEXMPZO,0001384198,J.C. Fisher,Ordered it for my son's 24th birthday. This was his favorite book as a child.
640,640,2,A1E45K0Z4C9L1M,0001384198,Cara,"I get doing voices for kids, I like that, but this narrator was all over the map, and inconsistent in even keeping the same voice for the same character.  I give it two stars for my child's vote (although that could be because it was a train story) but for both myself and my husband, this was an epic thumbs down."
641,641,1,A2VCSJ5ZGTW4LQ,0001384198,kwb,"This is a miniature, abridged version of the book that you can mail to someone. This isn't written super clear in the description. Was very disappointed when I saw it wasn't the actual book."

648,648,5,A3JCDYJVUHLBN3,0001384198,Sara E. Sims,The is the companion book that I give with OH BABY THE PLACES YOU WILL GO.  Keep reading it through childhood and let your child know that with work and a positive attitude s/he can accomplish wonderful things.

651,651,5,A1QS84F49IX0Y9,0001384198,Maurtee,"It was wonderful to read such a positive happy and motivating story and remember my mother reading it to me more than forty years ago. I recommend every parent to read it to their child. And the two stars, both engine and train were both female!"
652,652,1,A9SHH2RZPPYBV,0001384198,Joanne Durante,"Very dissapointed!  It was not a book, tiny and abridged.  The picture is misleading"
653,653,5,A3V6SQAAO721DC,0001384198,Billy,one of the best books ever.
654,654,5,A2MVXJ5AKHO7T5,0001384198,Amazon Customer,"Loved this for my two year old!  The story is not super short or super long - maybe a little longer than most toddlers might sit through
but easy to skip words if necessary.  The clown in this is not scary just an fyi.  Sweet keepsake book!"
655,655,1,A2TX1QATOIKSEP,0001384198,Tameka Q.,I am so disappointed. I read this same book at school and I really like it so I decided to order the same copy for my personal use only to discover that it's small book not regular size and the pictures are faded like its an old version.
656,656,5,A13VUNP9EECQHP,0001384198,hbmunchen,"Lovely book, large format, not a board book. Lovely illustrations and story."

661,661,5,A1XFS1SIJ3JEOT,0001384198,Wms. Gramma,My grandson loves anything about trains! Loves the book.

663,663,5,AAOBGVA7SI5BB,0001384198,TW,Charming and engaging.  Also very handy as I use AirPlay so my class can read along.
664,664,5,AAMTB848RMXRS,0001384198,David E.,Grandkids love it!
665,665,5,A12LGB549BKPY6,0001384198,F,"Loved this book as a child and bought it for my 3 year old nephew who enjoys it just as much! I read it to my little baby too, he loves looking at the pictures (for now!)."
666,666,5,A1WQPID8H7JOD9,0001384198,Heather Johnson,i can't even believe how many nights my son has picked this book at bedtime. He first got it when he was almost 2 and now he's 3+ and still loves it. The pictures are bright and gorgeous. I love the emotions on the characters' faces. We've used this book to teach my son about saying please and thank you and about trying hard and helping. Bonus: the main character little engine that could is a GIRL. So so so many of the kids' books have male protagonists. For animals and trains and trucks they are almost always boys.
667,667,1,A1AJ7E53K796VB,0001384198,Shawnte,Way smaller than I thought
668,668,5,A3FX1OUSY6HZ9G,0001384198,Stephanie,"I buy books for my nephew, who turned 1 on Christmas Day. My brother and sister-in-law read to him every day so I buy all ranges of books to add variety for them (the adults). This is a great, classic story. I like the illustrations in this version."
669,669,4,A34XULOHRXQ247,0001384198,Melindachas,"I would give 5 stars, but the book we received from Jenson Online Inc. had an address label on the back that was almost impossible to remove and left some residual sticky film that I've had trouble with.  I wasn't expecting this when I ordered the book.  Of course the book gets 5 stars though.  4 stars for having to remove the frustrating address label."
670,670,5,A2PF64RBR1G1SZ,0001384198,Madison T. Edwards,This is a classic story about never giving up and believing in yourself. I loved this as a child and my children love it too.

676,676,5,A8RTFTEE1SU7K,0001384198,Deborah Lewis,Read this as a child and now I read it to my grandson. He loves it

683,683,5,A3IL4ZK9PPLWBC,0001384198,Doc K.,"This is a magnificently printed and profusely illustrated edition of one of the true children's classics.  Don't be fooled by other abridged editions or flimsy books -- this is an item that can be passed down from one generation to the next.

I purchased the story (one with different pictures) and found that it just wasn't the same!  I was so disappointed!  So I searched until I found the same one I had as a child and this is it!!!  Love the message of continuing to try, of being helpful to others, and the role of encouragement.  I have purchased one for each of my grandchildren.  THIS ONE is the best!"

714,714,2,AWP53ZSC8TBXT,0001384198,Ruba,This is an abridged version of the story and is not a great retelling. I don't understand why babies wouldn't want to hear the whole thing...

A classic -- we have the version from when I was a child and bought this as back up since the ""vintage"" version is showing a little too much wear. Only down is that this book can be a bit lengthy and my son wants to read it every night/ day, multi times, so....
I also love that Little Engine is a female engine. Girl power."

739,739,5,A3TEMOQZ2DQY07,0001384198,Shan,Wonderful story and a classic my daughter can enjoy for a very long time.
740,740,1,A1WWSC0T3II8A,0001384198,Stella Padgett,when I read the description of the condition of this particular item I ordered it because it said that everything was in working order. I took that to mean that this item included the wind up train that originally came with it. When the item arrived it was just the book without the wind up train. Not a very accurate description of the product.
741,741,5,A3FQ6S8ZN081T4,0001384198,Lola,"I have loved this book since I was a child and remember the message of the story so many decades later: be compassionate and never doubt yourself.

From my memory (having last read this years ago), the story revolves around a train that was carrying toys and treats to children at the other side of a mountain. The train breaks down and multiple trains pass by - they try to solicit help from each train but no train is willing to assist them. Finally comes a small train who, because of her size, doesn't think she is capable of pulling them over the mountain, but is moved by her compassion. While pulling the train, she tells herself over and over, ""I think I can, I think I can."" And she does. :)

A wonderful, sweet story with a good message and beautiful illustrations. This book is a must-have."
742,742,2,A2JWKFFV8WVW16,0001384198,Orcas Art,The new illustrations are not the charming ones of the original. I'm surprised at seeing them. I returned the book for the original and am delighted as are my children and grandchildren

I highly recommend this book for children of all ages."

754,754,5,A1E32NJ27OAH7K,0001384198,Toni Banks,"The story I remember most from  my childhood. I sent this copy to my 8 month old great-grandson, Seth, knowing that his Mom my granddaughter will read it to him until he is able to read himself which will be sooner than most may expect since we are an early reader family."
755,755,5,A2ADX7JIEJHS8C,0001384198,Lynn Shaw,"This is a classic that I have given to many children over the years.  They love it, and will repeat, ""I think I can,......."" with you as you read."
756,756,5,A296O33PHOSXUJ,0001384198,kendel,Such a great book. I remember this one from my childhood. My baby was born premature and fought for his life. I decided this book would be the prefect book for him. I wanted him to know even though he was super tiny. He could do it and he did. I love this book.
757,757,3,A3L0NYXT0D1B8P,0001384198,JimMc,Be sure to read book description. This book is the actual size of an index card. I purchased to share with a class of first graders and it was difficult to read to them and share pictures. Needed class magnifier to assist.

760,760,5,A1TWMOZ5J7CFDV,0001384198,Wendy,"This classic has always been one of my favorite stories. I've I do believe I have tried to incorporate its timeless message into my life.  We should never give up, even if all the odds appear to be against us. We should believe in the possibility of our own strength. You can't necessarily count on those who appear to have the strength, or expertise, or life experience. Give a chance to the underdog. And that underdog just might be you!"

764,764,4,A236RYQL6BR1UN,0001384198,Mrs. Deane,"I gave four stars, only because this version was quite small. However, if you love the story, I would suggest simply finding a larger version. There is so much to see in the pictures, and it can be missed in this small form. I think this would be a perfect gift to give away to guests at a train theme party, though!"
765,765,3,A3TKNOO5Y4XLVK,0001384198,Betsy,"When I bought this, the picture didn't give any hint as to the miniature nature of this book, so I was shocked when I opened the package and found this 4x4 little thing. I know that's my fault for not reading the item details, but I think the picture should make it more clear that this is basically meant to be a postcard, not a book for a child's collection.

I ended up sending it to a friend (all you need to do is stick three stamps on it and it's good to go), otherwise I'd post a picture to show that it's about the size of a coaster."

My original copy had long disappeared and I just really wanted the book and its message back in my collection. None of us are too old to absorb the messages that it brings. I'd suggest one copy for all grandparents and a additional copies as gifts for each grandchild. Actually ir would make a great graduation gift in todays world.

791,791,5,A2QBNRAR61JOL6,0001384198,Natalie Holland,This book is a classic and always has been one of my favorites. Def a must have when it comes to buying books for kids.
792,792,5,A9S5R1KBUBWU2,0001384198,Jennifer Design,"awesome book. i purchased this for my little nephew, but i think my (adult) sister loves this book more than he does.... probably because it's a throw back to our childhood..... not sure, but was a very good purchase. :)"
793,793,2,A1T8UDXBW9J8EA,0001384198,D. Clancy,"Sure, my kid loves it. But I can see why they have published multiple abridged versions. The original text is awkward and wordy. The story structure is also all wrong. There are three antagonist engines before the hero is introduced when two would do the job. Each time and engine stops they repeat the same wordy sentence. And only at the last ""bad"" engine do they introduce the gimmick of the book which everyone remembers -- where engines puff their thoughts in short little sentences. It would make a lot more sense if all the engines talked like the hero in short puffs.

The layout is also questionable. Long sentences break up between pages awkwardly and are hard to get out in a single breath.

Lastly, the hero's part and the Act III conclusion are way too short. It should have taken up a greater page count -- or maybe lose the tedious setup."

799,799,3,A3LTQIL6HIE30C,0001384198,james L. Johnson,Got this after a nostalgia surge (and losing all my Little Golden Books). Great to preserve the story and would not be something I'd mind being subjected to the inevitable crayons but I miss the heft and feel of a 'book' opening to a story.
800,800,3,AJ8BZ8DD26LCC,0001384198,agirlwithaguitar,"Beware - this is an ""abridged"" version, so you're not getting the whole classic story here. I wanted the full one, so was disappointed."

805,805,3,A1IKBMMHMYC1V3,0001384198,lila,Cute book but it was missing the little train and had pen lines on the tracks in the book. It was used so I suppose it is normal.

For those who have complained about them making the train a female, thinking that this was a change from the original, they should be aware that in the original Watty Piper version , the train was a female.  In many later versions however (including the ones I knew when I was a kid), the train was a male.  I am deducting a star since the cover on mine arrived with a tear."

Now that Faithy is five and finally in school (we home schooled for Pre-K) I have had to step back in order to teach her the importance of doing things on her own.  Even though it has been very challenging to watch her have her fits (crying out of frustration) I try to encourage her to keep trying until she is able to it on her own.  These scenes play out most mornings when it is time to get ready for school, and she cant get her shirt or coat buttoned, and has a pant leg inside out and is struggling to fix it.

I am learning to understand the importance of letting the child solve their own little problems, especially with Faithy who for so long had everything done for her, thanks to aunts and uncles who loved feeding her, until it was completely inappropriate to do so, and who to this day think that she cant walk because they never put her down.

I cant possibly expect her teacher to spend time doing everything for her when she has a classroom of young, energized five year olds.  (I don't envy you Mrs LaFever)

The Importance of Trying Until You Can

For those of you that are unfamiliar with the story of the little engine that could, it is a story about a little blue engine that did what the other engines refused to do, after a train filled with toys and gifts for little boys and girls broke down.  The little blue engine tried her best, despite her small size to get to the little children.

If you are a mother who enjoys using great storytelling to create teachable moments, then this is the book that you need to add to your collection.

Read it with your children, they will love the story, and use the lesson when you notice frustration on their part because they cannot complete a task.

To help them to retain, come up with some fun activities that your children will enjoy doing, or have a nice discussion about times when we all feel as if we cant do something.  Are there things we can do accomplish our tasks, such as being patient, and counting when we start getting upset.  Every child is different, but they all love learning in fun settings."
884,884,4,ABOG0BVY6S91Y,0001384198,Lindsay,"The story and illustrations are great, I just wish the book itself was bigger. Just realize it's pocket-sized. Would be great to take on the go, but not a great bedtime story size. However, my kids still love reading it, even though it's small, and they haven't complained about the size. The story is classic and teaches a simple but great message. My kids (5 and 6 years old) love it, and I love that it has a nice message. Would definitely recommend the story itself, I just wish I would have ordered a bigger size (if there is one) so that when I read it to both my kids they can see the illustrations a little better."

915,915,5,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,0001384198,A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com,"The story is simple: We're stronger than we think. You know the story and you know the tagline.

I hadn't read this since childhood. Reading it again, seeing these pictures, made it alive again.

The pictures each are works of art. Drawing from classic comic strip styles, but elevating with a sort of depth not ordinarily seen in a children's book, they will amaze and engage.

As to the story -- wow! It is prose and poetry at once. It avoids sing-songy rhymes, but has a simple refrain that has pushed this into the canon of great children's literature.

922,922,2,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0001384198,Robert Beveridge,"Watty Piper, The Little Engine that Could (Platt and Munk, 1930)

When I was a kid, I was pretty open to reading just about anything, really, and there were very few books I simply did not like. One of them was The Little Engine that Could. Well, a copy of it popped into our house tonight thanks to the mother-in-law, and I read it to the Bean tonight. Forty years later, my opinion of the book has not changed one bit. Repetitive prose, unlikable characters (in the engines who refuse), trite, inspirational resolution...I wouldn't have put things in those words when I was four, of course, at that time all I knew was that I was bored by it compared to other books in my collection of which I wore out multiple copies (Big Max, The Snowy Day, Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, I could go on all day), but now, with a quarter-century of analysis and criticism behind me, I can put fingers on why the book rubbed me the wrong way so badly when I was young. And it still does. I know it is beloved of millions, but sorry, folks, I have never been able to get on this bandwagon, and at this point it's pretty obvious I never will. * "

I'm planning to return mine as it's not what I was expecting. If you're looking for the original story in a normal size make sure you aren't ordering the Little Letters Edition. It is around the size of a cd case as it's set up to be mailed to someone, and would work for that if you want to do something like that or carry it in a purse or diaper bag etc. If that's the case, then this would work well for that."

928,928,3,A3W1ZOQE7TGXM0,0001384198,Thrifty Dad,"Great story but the product description needs work.

This book was so small, when I opened my Amazon package I almost mistook it for an advertisement thrown in with the order.  It's literally the size of a thinner CD case, not the thicker case normally seen with music CD's for those of you that still buy those.

Also, this book is the ""Abridged Edition"", which is in the Amazon picture but unless you were looking for it specifically, it's too small to notice.  Not sure why you'd want an abridged version of this book, it's a children's book, how much shorter do you need it to be?

If you want a travel size book that isn't very bulky or heavy, then this is the book for you.  If you want something large enough to read to your child and see large pictures, look for a normal sized book."

I just wish the title said ""The Little Engine That Could, Abridged."" I bought this from my mobile phone, without reading the fine print, assuming I'd get the normal book. Time to find a normal copy. Perhaps in a physical bookstore this time. Or carefully reading reviews. Looking on a desktop, there seem to be dozens of different versions, all butchered in different ways.

Perhaps Amazon could find a way to place the normal edition at the top of the listings?"

In the picture the seller posted, it was the same one.  (Not the one that's pictured here.)  Several reviewers had stated that the book listed was NOT the one pictured...but I didn't listen and ordered it.  I like the original story (why did they change the gender of the little engine?)  and the original illustrations.  I was disappointed in this book and did not give it as a going away gift for a daycare child who loved the original story, as I had planned to do.

That said, it is well-written and illustrated.  A good book, just not what I was looking for.  Hopefully going forward the photo will be the correct one so that others don't make the same mistake I did."

They are almost identical but with subtle differences.  My daughter asks for ""choo-choo"" almost every night.  I never noticed, until another reviewer pointed it out, that all of the mean, bad trains are male and the nice, friendly trains are female.  I agree that it's a little weird. Who knows whether it was intentional by the author or just an unconscious issue, but it's hard to disregard.  However, I doubt that it really matters much, this is still a great book, and now I try to avoid making deep male voices for all the mean trains and female voices for all the nice trains."

It's refreshing to read a story to my daughter where the default character (be it a duck, pig, train, robot or human) isn't male. She'll have time enough in society to learn that the default human is a white male and everything else is an ""other,"" I really don't need children's books to start hammering that message in while she's not yet old enough to poop in the potty.

I believe it was read to me repeatedly before I could read (and I learned to read VERY young--before I was out of diapers). The illustrations were SO vivid; it's rare to find a book that's so charmingly illustrated. The story, of course, is about the Little Blue Engine, who has a positive attitude as compared with some of the less admirable traits of his fellow engines. Some of them are stuck up or snobby or full of negativity. The trains and even the cargo have personalities. (My sister and I liked the dolls.) And then one day, when faced with the possibility of some children over the mountain NOT GETTING THEIR CHRISTMAS GIFTS IN TIME (gasp!), the Little Blue Engine is the only one with enough motivation to drag those heavy cars up the steep tracks and save the day. I loved how ""I-think-I-can"" sounded so much like a train noise, and I could definitely imagine using it as a chant for little kids preparing for a difficult feat."
